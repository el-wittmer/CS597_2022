### Files in this directory: 

[Leng_2022_Nodes.csv](Leng_2022_Nodes.csv) The data for each publication in Leng's (2022) study, including first author, title, and topic of discussion. The only changes I made were separating some of the citation data from one "Label" category into first author, title, and publishing journal categories. 

[Leng_2022_Edges.csv](Leng_2022_Edges.csv) The citation data from Leng's (2022) study. Includes citations to Paul et al. (1963) as well as citations between network nodes

[kannel64.csv](kannel64.csv) Citation data for Kannel et al. (1964), which I used to compare against Paul et al.'s (1963) citation counts from 1964-1984
