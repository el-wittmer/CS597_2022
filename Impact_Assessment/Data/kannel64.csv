We aimed to investigate the association between blood lipids and socio-economic and educational strata in adults not taking lipid-lowering medications. Methods A cross-sectional, population-based study enrolled 1614 individuals not taking lipid-lowering medications. Sociodemographic characteristics, monthly income, education level and the number of consumer goods available at home were obtained and individuals were classified into five socio-economic categories. Blood lipids were obtained in fasting participants. Results In men, the higher the socio-economic or educational stratum, the higher the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglyceride (TG) levels and the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), after controlling for age, body mass index, hypertension, smoking habit and physical activity. In women, the higher socio-economic strata were associated with elevated total cholesterol and HDL-c, while lower total cholesterol, LDL-c and TG levels were found in those with higher education levels. Also, individuals in the upper socio-economic strata had higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL-c, showing more than two times higher odds of having multiple alterations in blood lipids (men: OR 2.99 [95% CI 1.23 to 5.07]; women: OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.09 to 5.83]). Conclusions Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent in developing countries. Individuals in the highest socio-economic category are the ones at higher risk for dyslipidemia. This phenomenon calls for strategies to stimulate healthy diet habits and a physically active lifestyle to minimize health problems.","[Espirito Santo, Lucandra R.; Xavier, Lorena A.; Mota, Gabriel A.] Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Med, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Faria, Thais O.] Prominas Univ, Dept Nursing, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Silva, Carla Silvana O.] Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Nursing, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Reis, Vivianne C.] Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Phys Educ, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Silveira, Marise F.] Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Stat, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Mill, Jose Geraldo] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Physiol Sci, BR-27042755 Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Baldo, Marcelo P.] UniFIPMOC, Ctr Univ, Dept Med, BR-39408007 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Baldo, Marcelo P.] Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Pathophysiol, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil",,"Baldo, MP (corresponding author), UniFIPMOC, Ctr Univ, Dept Med, BR-39408007 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil.;Baldo, MP (corresponding author), Montes Claros State Univ, Dept Pathophysiol, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil.",marcelobaldo@ymail.com,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1,2022,14,4,,,,,346,353,,10.1093/inthealth/ihz089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihz089,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000819594200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lipid dysregulation is a well-known precursor to metabolic diseases, including CVD. There is a growing body of literature that suggests MRI-derived epicardial fat volume, or epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume, is linked to the development of coronary artery disease. Interestingly, epicardial fat is also actively involved in lipid and energy homeostasis, with epicardial adipose tissue having a greater capacity for release and uptake of free fatty acids. However, there is a scarcity of knowledge on the influence of plasma lipids on EAT volume. AimThe focus of this study is on the identification of novel lipidomic species associated with CMRI-derived measures of epicardial fat in Mexican American individuals. MethodsWe performed lipidomic profiling on 200 Mexican American individuals. High-throughput mass spectrometry enabled rapid capture of precise lipidomic profiles, providing measures of 799 unique species from circulating plasma samples. Because of our extended pedigree design, we utilized a standard quantitative genetic linear mixed model analysis to determine whether lipids were correlated with EAT by formally testing for association between each lipid species and the CMRI epicardial fat phenotype. ResultsAfter correction for multiple testing using the FDR approach, we identified 135 lipid species showing significant association with epicardial fat. Of those, 131 lipid species were positively correlated with EAT, where increased circulating lipid levels were correlated with increased epicardial fat. Interestingly, the top 10 lipid species associated with an increased epicardial fat volume were from the deoxyceramide (Cer(m)) and triacylglycerol (TG) families. Deoxyceramides are atypical and neurotoxic sphingolipids. Triacylglycerols are an abundant lipid class and comprise the bulk of storage fat in tissues. Pathologically elevated TG and Cer(m) levels are related to CVD risk and, in our study, to EAT volume. ConclusionOur results indicate that specific lipid abnormalities such as enriched saturated triacylglycerols and the presence of toxic ceramides Cer(m) in plasma of our individuals could precede CVD with increased EAT volume.","[Leandro, Ana Cristina; Almeida, Marcio; Kuokkanen, Mikko; Diego, Vincent P.; Duggirala, Ravindranath; Blangero, John; Curran, Joanne E.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Human Genet, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA; [Michael, Laura F.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Huynh, Kevin; Giles, Corey; Duong, Thy; Meikle, Peter J.] Baker Heart & Diabet Inst, Metabol Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Huynh, Kevin; Giles, Corey; Meikle, Peter J.] Univ Melbourne, Baker Dept Cardiometab Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Clarke, Geoffrey D.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr, Res Imaging Inst, Dept Radiol, San Antonio, TX USA; [Leandro, Ana Cristina; Almeida, Marcio; Kuokkanen, Mikko; Diego, Vincent P.; Duggirala, Ravindranath; Blangero, John; Curran, Joanne E.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, South Texas Diabet & Obes Inst, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA",,"Curran, JE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Human Genet, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.;Curran, JE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, South Texas Diabet & Obes Inst, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",joanne.curran@utrgv.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 6,2022,9,,,,,,,,889985,10.3389/fcvm.2022.889985,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.889985,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000813312400001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Cho, KH",,,,"Cho, Kyung-Hyun",,,The Current Status of Research on High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL): A Paradigm Shift from HDL Quantity to HDL Quality and HDL Functionality,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"The quantity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) is represented as the serum HDL-C concentration (mg/dL), while the HDL quality manifests as the diverse features of protein and lipid content, extent of oxidation, and extent of glycation. The HDL functionality represents several performance metrics of HDL, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol efflux activities. The quantity and quality of HDL can change during one's lifetime, depending on infection, disease, and lifestyle, such as dietary habits, exercise, and smoking. The quantity of HDL can change according to age and gender, such as puberty, middle-aged symptoms, climacteric, and the menopause. HDL-C can decrease during disease states, such as acute infection, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune disease, while it can be increased by regular aerobic exercise and healthy food consumption. Generally, high HDL-C at the normal level is associated with good HDL quality and functionality. Nevertheless, high HDL quantity is not always accompanied by good HDL quality or functionality. The HDL quality concerns the morphology of the HDL, such as particle size, shape, and number. The HDL quality also depends on the composition of the HDL, such as apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, apoC-III, serum amyloid A, and alpha-synuclein), cholesterol, and triglyceride. The HDL quality is also associated with the extent of HDL modification, such as glycation and oxidation, resulting in the multimerization of apoA-I, and the aggregation leads to amyloidogenesis. The HDL quality frequently determines the HDL functionality, which depends on the attached antioxidant enzyme activity, such as the paraoxonase and cholesterol efflux activity. Conventional HDL functionality is regression, the removal of cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions, and the removal of oxidized species in low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Recently, HDL functionality was reported to expand the removal of beta-amyloid plaque and inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation in the brain to attenuate Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, respectively. More recently, HDL functionality has been associated with the susceptibility and recovery ability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by inhibiting the activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The appearance of dysfunctional HDL is frequently associated with many acute infectious diseases and chronic aging-related diseases. An HDL can be a suitable biomarker to diagnose many diseases and their progression by monitoring the changes in its quantity and quality in terms of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities. An HDL can be a protein drug used for the removal of plaque and as a delivery vehicle for non-soluble drugs and genes. A dysfunctional HDL has poor HDL quality, such as a lower apoA-I content, lower antioxidant ability, smaller size, and ambiguous shape. The current review analyzes the recent advances in HDL quantity, quality, and functionality, depending on the health and disease state during one's lifetime.","[Cho, Kyung-Hyun] Yeungnam Univ, LipoLab, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea; [Cho, Kyung-Hyun] Raydel Res Inst, Med Innovat Complex, Daegu 41061, South Korea",,"Cho, KH (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, LipoLab, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.;Cho, KH (corresponding author), Raydel Res Inst, Med Innovat Complex, Daegu 41061, South Korea.",chok@yu.ac.kr,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,23,7,,,,,,,3967,10.3390/ijms23073967,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23073967,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000781073400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent Findings Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for ASCVD worldwide. Randomized controlled trial evidence supports initiation of antihypertensive medication for stage 2 hypertension regardless of ASCVD risk. The HOPE-3 trial tested statin therapy in intermediate-risk individuals (defined as an annual risk of major cardiovascular events of approximately 1%) for primary prevention of ASCVD and reported significant reductions in cardiovascular events in all statin treatment arms, with the greatest benefit observed in patients in the highest tertile of systolic blood pressure. Based on the current data, patients with stage 2 hypertension with an indication for antihypertensive therapy may benefit from the addition of statin therapy in the primary prevention setting. Patients with hypertension have an elevated risk for ASCVD that appears to be modifiable beyond implementation of antihypertensive therapy. The addition of statin therapy in patients treated with antihypertensive therapy may further help to lower risk of future cardiovascular events.","[McNavish, Daniel E.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [German, Charles A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Cardiol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shapiro, Michael D.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Ctr Prevent Cardiovasc Dis, Sect Cardiovasc Med, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA",,"Shapiro, MD (corresponding author), Wake Forest Sch Med, Ctr Prevent Cardiovasc Dis, Sect Cardiovasc Med, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA.",dmcnavis@wakehealth.edu; mdshapir@wakehealth.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,24,1,,,,,21,27,,10.1007/s11906-022-01167-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11906-022-01167-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000758322700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

EL (endothelial lipase) hydrolyzes phospholipids promoting catabolism of HDL and subsequent renal excretion. MEDI5884 is a selective, humanized, monoclonal, EL-neutralizing antibody. We sought to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple doses of MEDI5884 in patients with stable coronary artery disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: LEGACY was a phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial that randomized 132 patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving high-intensity statin therapy to 3 monthly doses of 1 of 5 dose levels of MEDI5884 (50, 100, 200, 350, or 500 mg SC) or matching placebo. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability of MEDI5884 through the end of the study (day 151). Additional end points included change in HDL cholesterol and cholesterol efflux from baseline to day 91, hepatic uptake of cholesterol at day 91, changes in various other lipid parameters. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the placebo and MEDI5884 groups. In a dose-dependent manner, MEDI5884 increased HDL cholesterol up to 51.4% (P<0.0001) and global cholesterol efflux up to 26.2% ([95% CI, 14.3-38.0] P<0.0001). MEDI5884 increased HDL particle number up to 14.4%. At the highest dose tested, an increase in LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol up to 28.7% (P<0.0001) and apoB (apolipoprotein B) up to 13.1% (P=0.04) was observed with MEDI5884. However, at the potential target doses for future studies, there was no meaningful increase in LDL cholesterol or apoB. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of EL by MEDI5884 increases the quantity and quality of functional HDL in patients with stable coronary artery disease on high-intensity statin therapy without an adverse safety signal at the likely dose to be used. These data support further clinical investigation.","[Ruff, Christian T.; Kuder, Julia F.; Murphy, Sabina A.; Sabatine, Marc S.] Harvard Med Sch, TIMI Study Grp, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Koren, Michael J.] Jacksonville Ctr Clin Res, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Grimsby, Joseph; Karathanasis, Sotirios K.] AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, Biosci, Cardiovasc Renal & Metab,Res & Early Dev, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Tu, Xiao; Falloon, Judith; Hirshberg, Boaz; George, Richard T.] AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, Early Clin Dev, Res & Early Dev,Cardiovasc Renal & Metab, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Hsia, Judith] AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, Res & Early Dev, Cardiovasc Renal & Metab, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Tsai, Lan-Feng] AstraZeneca, BioPharmaceut R&D, Res & Early Dev, Cardiovasc Renal & Metab,Early CVRM Biometr, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Rosenbaum, Anton, I; Guan, Ye] AstraZeneca, R&D, MD Integrated Bioanal Clin Pharmacol & Quantitat, San Francisco, CA USA; [Hummer, B.

LDL-c, as a quantitative trait, is multifactorial and depends on both genetic and environmental factors. In the pregenomic age, targeted genes were used to detect genetic factors in both hyper- and hypolipidemias, but this approach only explained extreme cases in the population distribution. Subsequently, the genetic basis of the less severe and most common dyslipidemias remained unknown. In the genomic age, performing whole-exome sequencing in families with extreme plasma LDL-c values identified some new candidate genes, but it is unlikely that such genes can explain the majority of inexplicable cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with plasma LDL-c, introducing the idea of a polygenic origin. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs), including LDL-c-raising alleles, were developed to measure the contribution of the accumulation of small-effect variants to plasma LDL-c. This paper discusses other possibilities for unexplained dyslipidemias associated with LDL-c, such as mosaicism, maternal effect, and induced epigenetic changes. Future studies should consider gene-gene and gene-environment interactions and the development of integrated information about disease-driving networks, including phenotypes, genotypes, transcription, proteins, metabolites, and epigenetics.","[Maria Martin-Campos, Jesus] Hosp Santa Creu & St Pau IR HSCSP, Inst Recerca, Biomed Res Inst St Pau IIB St Pau, Stroke Pharmacogen & Genet Grp, C St Quinti 77-79, Barcelona 08041, Spain",,"Martin-Campos, JM (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Creu & St Pau IR HSCSP, Inst Recerca, Biomed Res Inst St Pau IIB St Pau, Stroke Pharmacogen & Genet Grp, C St Quinti 77-79, Barcelona 08041, Spain.",jmartinca@santpau.cat,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,9,11,,,,,,,1728,10.3390/biomedicines9111728,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9111728,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000723380500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the years there accumulated a growing body of evidence from epidemiology and controlled clinical studies that the consumption of SFA per se was not associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and the limitation of consumption of SFA did not show a preventive effect. The focus on the SFA content negated the biologically heterogeneous and sometimes biologically favorable effects of various SFAs. In addition, it was neglected that SFAs in foodstuffs are bound in a variety of complex matrices, which are composed of dozens of nutrients with different structures and concomitant substances and therefore each triggers different biological responses and metabolic effects. Accordingly, such nutrient-based recommendations are principally not very productive and also difficult to realize.

Methods and results This study included 606 asymptomatic adults (49% men, aged 567 years) recruited from communities in three states of Australia during 2017-2018. CCS was measured using coronary computed tomography scan at recruitment. Annual PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were estimated on the year before recruitment using statistical exposure models and assigned to each participant's residential address. Medical history, physical measurements, biochemistry, and sociodemographic and socioeconomic status were also recorded. Median concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 were 6.9 mu g/m(3) [interquartile range (IQR) 6.0-7.7)] and 3.1 ppb [IQR 2.2-4.5], respectively. Of the 606 participants, 16% had high CCS (>= 100) and 4% had very high CCS (>= 400). Exposure to higher PM2.5 (per mu g/m(3)) was significantly associated with greater odds of having high CCS (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.43) and very high CCS (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05-2.29). Similar associations were observed for NO2 and high CCS (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.27) and very high CCS (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.51). These findings were robust to adjustment for sociodemographic factors, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, education, and socio-economic status.

The risk factors for lipemic plasma in donated blood are not completely known. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence plasma to be fatty so that we can prevent further storage costs and eliminate unusable transfusion units. Methods This case-control study was conducted in 2017, and 1552 respondents were included in the study. The control group included 1502 subjects whose blood was not lipemic, while 50 patients with lipemic blood were selected for the case group. The presence of lipemic blood was assessed by inspection, while data were collected by clinical laboratory tests and a questionnaire. Results Our findings show that multiple blood donors with lipemic blood were significantly older (p < 0.0005) and have higher systolic and diastolic pressure (p < 0.0005), high triglyceride levels (p < 0.0005), and lower levels of hemoglobin (p < 0.0005).

Because cholesterol depletion also increases sheddase activity of the membrane protease ADAM17 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17) in other cells, we examined if ADAM17 plays a role in HDL's effects on inflammatory processes in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Approach and Results: Sorted peritoneal macrophages from human APOA1 (apolipoprotein A1) transgenic LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor-deficient (APOA1(Tg); Ldlr(-/-)) mice with and without myeloid cell-targeted ADAM17-deficiency were studied in parallel with wildtype and ADAM17-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with HDL in vitro. HDL increased ADAM17 expression and activity in macrophages. Furthermore, ADAM17-deficient macrophages exhibited reduced expression of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette A1) and reduced cholesterol efflux and were cholesterol loaded. This was caused by the absence of shedding of TNF alpha, a major ADAM17 substrate. Sorted thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages freshly isolated from APOA1(Tg); Ldlr(-/-) mice, which have higher HDL levels than Ldlr(-/-) controls, showed reduced expression of interferon-inducible genes in response to lipopolysaccharide or interferon beta, but exacerbated proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide for Tnfa, Cxcl1, Ccl2, and Il1b, phenocopying cells stimulated with HDL in vitro. These effects were all prevented in ADAM17-deficient macrophages and associated with lower concentrations of large HDL particles in APOA1(Tg); Ldlr(-/-) mice with myeloid cell-targeted ADAM17-deficiency. Conclusions: The increased cholesterol loading of ADAM17-deficient macrophages prevents both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory responses of HDL. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ADAM17 in maintaining cholesterol efflux in macrophages, thereby regulating the immune functions of these cells.","[Kothari, Vishal; Tang, Jingjing; He, Yi; Kramer, Farah; Kanter, Jenny E.; Bornfeldt, Karin E.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Metab Endocrinol & Nutr, UW Med Diabet Inst, 760 Republican St,Box 368062, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Bornfeldt, Karin E.] Univ Washington, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA",,"Bornfeldt, KE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Metab Endocrinol & Nutr, UW Med Diabet Inst, 760 Republican St,Box 368062, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",kbornfeldt@medicine.washington.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,41,6,,,,,1854,1873,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.315145,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.315145,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000655238200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was developed and administered to assess intuitive and rational judgments of cybersecurity risks. Two major findings of the study include: (1) three significant risk factors associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment were Age Group, Region, and Prior GenCyber Camp Experience. That is, younger students, the campers from the West region, and participants attending the camps before tended to have a lower level of cybersecurity judgment; and (2) two significant protective factors were Cyber Use Length and Current GenCyber Camp Experience, i.e., the experiences of both using computers, Internet, cellphones and participating in the current camps having significant advantages in judging cybersecurity risks intuitively and rationally. Thus, it is critical to use both the push strategy to minimize the risk factors and the pull strategy to maximize the protective factors.

Ceramide scores have been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with established coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of ceramide score has not been assessed in the general population. We tested the hypothesis that ceramide scores are associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in a community-based cohort with average coronary artery disease burden at enrollment. Approach and results: In a prospective community-based cohort, we performed passive follow-up using a record linkage system to ascertain the composite outcome of MACE, defined as acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization (bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention), stroke, or death. Ceramides were analyzed as log-transformed continuous variables, ratios or scores, and quartiles with adjustment for confounders. We analyzed 1131 subjects, 52% females, mean age +/-(SD) 64 +/- 9 years. After a median follow-up of 13.3 years (Q1, 12.7; Q3, 14.4), 486 patients experienced a MACE: myocardial infarction (80), coronary artery bypass surgery (34), percutaneous coronary intervention (62), stroke (94), and all-cause death (362). Ceramide ratios were significantly associated with MACE independently of LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and conventional coronary artery disease risk factors. Those in the highest quartile of ceramide score had nearly 1.5-fold risk of MACE, hazard ratio, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.12-1.92). There was a dose-response association across quartiles of ceramide ratios and MACE. Conclusions: Elevated ceramide score is a robust predictor of cardiovascular disease and MACE in the community. The risk conferred by the ceramide score has a dose-response behavior and is independent of conventional risk factors.","[Vasile, Vlad C.; Meeusen, Jeffrey W.; Donato, Leslie J.; Jaffe, Allan S.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN USA; [Vasile, Vlad C.; Inojosa, Jose R.

H.",,,"Relationship between lipoproteins, thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation",CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"The prothrombotic state in atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs as a result of multifaceted interactions, known as Virchow's triad of hypercoagulability, structural abnormalities, and blood stasis. More recently, there is emerging evidence that lipoproteins are implicated in this process, beyond their traditional role in atherosclerosis. In this review, we provide an overview of the various lipoproteins and explore the association between lipoproteins and AF, the effects of lipoproteins on haemostasis, and the potential contribution of lipoproteins to thrombogenesis in AF. There are several types of lipoproteins based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoprotein category, namely: chylomicrons, very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein. Each of these lipoproteins may contain numerous lipid species and proteins with a variety of different functions. Furthermore, the lipoprotein particles may be oxidized causing an alteration in their structure and content. Of note, there is a paradoxical inverse relationship between total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and incident AF. The mechanism by which this occurs may be related to the stabilizing effect of cholesterol on myocardial membranes, along with its role in inflammation. Overall, specific lipoproteins may interact with haemostatic pathways to promote excess platelet activation and thrombin generation, as well as inhibiting fibrinolysis. In this regard, LDL-C has been shown to be an independent risk factor for thromboembolic events in AF. The complex relationship between lipoproteins, thrombosis and AF warrants further research with an aim to improve our knowledge base and contribute to our overall understanding of lipoprotein-mediated thrombosis.","[Ding, Wern Yew; Lip, Gregory Y.

Early prediction and prevention could greatly reduce the enormous socio-economic burden posed by CVDs. Plasma lipids have been at the center stage of the prediction and prevention strategies for CVDs that have mostly relied on traditional lipids (total cholesterol, total triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C). The tremendous advancement in the field of lipidomics in last two decades has facilitated the research efforts to unravel the metabolic dysregulation in CVDs and their genetic determinants, enabling the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and identification of predictive biomarkers, beyond traditional lipids. This review presents an overview of the application of lipidomics in epidemiological and genetic studies and their contributions to the current understanding of the field. We review findings of these studies and discuss examples that demonstrates the potential of lipidomics in revealing new biology not captured by traditional lipids and lipoprotein measurements. The promising findings from these studies have raised new opportunities in the fields of personalized and predictive medicine for CVDs. The review further discusses prospects of integrating emerging genomics tools with the high-dimensional lipidome to move forward from the statistical associations towards biological understanding, therapeutic target development and risk prediction.

When patients were divided into quartiles of systolic BP-SD (<8.20, 8.20-10.49, 10.50-13.19, and >= 13.20 mm Hg), hazard ratios (HRs) for all adverse events were significantly high in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile (HR, 2.00, 95% CI, 1.15-3.49, P=0.015 for thromboembolism; HR, 2.60, 95% CI, 1.36-4.97, P=0.004 for major hemorrhage; and HR, 1.85, 95% CI, 1.11-3.07, P=0.018 for all-cause death) after adjusting for components of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, warfarin and antiplatelet use, atrial fibrillation type, BP measurement times, and others. These findings were consistent when BP-coefficient of variation was used instead of BP-SD. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic BP visit-to-visit variability was significantly associated with all adverse events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Further studies are needed to clarify the causality between BP variability and adverse outcomes in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.","[Kodani, Eitaro] Tama Nagayama Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Cardiol, Nippon Med Sch, 1-7-1 Nagayama, Tokyo 2068512, Japan; [Inoue, Hiroshi] Saiseikai Toyama Hosp, Toyama, Japan; [Atarashi, Hirotsugu] Minami Hachioji Hosp, Tokyo, Japan; [Okumura, Ken] Saiseikai Kumamoto Hosp, Kumamoto, Japan; [Yamashita, Takeshi] Cardiovasc Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Otsuka, Toshiaki] Nippon Med Sch, Dept Hyg & Publ Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Origasa, Hideki] Univ Toyama, Div Biostat & Clin Epidemiol, Toyama, Japan",,"Kodani, E (corresponding author), Tama Nagayama Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Cardiol, Nippon Med Sch, 1-7-1 Nagayama, Tokyo 2068512, Japan.",kodani@nms.ac.jp,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 5,2021,10,1,,,,,,,e018585,10.1161/JAHA.120.018585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.018585,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000607087000030,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, adjunctive surrogates for cardiovascular risk validated by some studies include arterial stiffness and endothelial function indexes. To date, no randomized trial has addressed the possible effects of antidiabetic interventional drugs such as GLP1 agonists on endothelial and arterial stiffness indexes as surrogate markers of vascular damage.AimsWe aimed to evaluate metabolic efficacy and surrogate vascular efficacy endpoints of once-weekly dulaglutide (1.5 mg) plus traditional antidiabetic treatment compared with traditional antidiabetic treatment alone in subjects with type 2 diabetes.MethodsMen and women (aged >= 50 years) with established or newly detected type 2 diabetes whose HbA1c level was 9.5% or less on stable doses of up to two oral glucose lowering drugs with or without basal insulin therapy were eligible for randomization. Subcutaneous dulaglutide was initiated at the full dose (1.5 mg/day weekly). Arterial stiffness (PWV: pulse wave velocity and augmentation index) and endothelial function (RHI: reactive hyperaemia index) were evaluated at baseline and at three-month and nine-month examination visits. At each visit (at 3 and 9 months), the subjects were also evaluated for glycaemic variables such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c and lipid variables such as total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.ResultsAt the three-month follow-up, the subjects treated with dulaglutide showed significantly lower serum levels of FPG and HbA1c than control subjects treated with conventional therapy. At the 9-month follow-up, subjects treated with dulaglutide showed significant lower values of the mean diastolic blood pressure, BMI, total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, FPG, HbA1c and PWV and higher mean RHI values than control subjects treated with conventional therapy.ConclusionsOur randomized trial showed that subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with conventional therapy plus 1.5 mg/day of subcutaneous dulaglutide compared with subjects treated with conventional therapy alone showed favourable metabolic effects associated with positive effects on vascular health markers such as arterial stiffness and endothelial function markers. These findings are consistent with previous study findings indicating the strict relationship between cardiovascular risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol and LDL levels and cardiovascular events and vascular health surrogate markers.","[Tuttolomondo, Antonino; Cirrincione, Anna; Casuccio, Alessandra; Del Cuore, Alessandro; Daidone, Mario; Di Chiara, Tiziana; Di Raimondo, Domenico; Della Corte, Vittoriano; Maida, Carlo; Simonetta, Irene; Scaglione, Stefania; Pinto, Antonio] Univ Palermo Italy, Dept Promoting Hlth Maternal Infant Excellence &, Piazza Cliniche 2, I-90127 Palermo, Italy; [Tuttolomondo, Antonino; Del Cuore, Alessandro; Daidone, Mario; Di Chiara, Tiziana; Di Raimondo, Domenico; Della Corte, Vittoriano; Maida, Carlo; Simonetta, Irene; Scaglione, Stefania; Pinto, Antonio] Policlin P Giaccone, Internal Med & Stroke Care Ward, Palermo, Italy; [Della Corte, Vittoriano; Maida, Carlo] Univ Palermo, PhD Programme Mol & Clin Med, Piazza Clin 2, I-90127 Palermo, Italy",,"Tuttolomondo, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo Italy, Dept Promoting Hlth Maternal Infant Excellence &, Piazza Cliniche 2, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",bruno.tuttolomondo@unipa.it,,,,,,,,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 4,2021,20,1,,,,,,,1,10.1186/s12933-020-01183-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-020-01183-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000607061600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cholesterol plays an important role in the infection and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2, and the study of its mechanism is of great significance not only for the treatment of COVID-19 but also for research on generic antiviral drugs. Observations: Cholesterol promotes the development of atherosclerosis by activating NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and the resulting inflammatory environment indirectly contributes to COVID-19 infection and subsequent deterioration. In in vitro studies, membrane cholesterol increased the number of viral entry sites on the host cell membrane and the number of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the membrane fusion site. Previous studies have shown that the fusion protein of the virus interacts with cholesterol, and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also requires cholesterol to enter the host cells. Cholesterol in blood interacts with the spike protein to promote the entry of spike cells, wherein the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) plays an important role. Because of the cardiovascular protective effects of lipid-lowering therapy and the additional anti-inflammatory effects of lipid-lowering drugs, it is currently recommended to continue lipid-lowering therapy for patients with COVID-19, but the safety of extremely low LDL-C is questionable. Conclusions and Relevance: Cholesterol can indirectly increase the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the risk of death from COVID-19, which are mediated by NLRP3 and atherosclerotic plaques, respectively. Cholesterol present in the host cell membrane, virus, and blood may also directly participate in the virus cell entry process, but the specific mechanism still needs further study. Patients with COVID-19 are recommended to continue lipid-lowering therapy.","[Tang, Yan; Hu, Longtai; Liu, Yi; Zhou, Bangyi; Qin, Xiaohuan; Ye, Jujian; Zhang, Peidong] Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Ctr Heart, Dept Cardiol, 235 Ind Ave, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Maoze] Raoping Cty Peoples Hosp, Dept Cardiol, 161 Caichang St, Chaozhou 515700, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhijian] Southern Med Univ, Affiliated Boai Hosp Zhongshan, Dept Cardiol, 6 Chenggui Rd, Zhongshan 528403, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Longtai] Southern Med Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, 6 Chenggui Rd, Zhongshan 528403, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yan; Liu, Yi; Zhou, Bangyi; Qin, Xiaohuan; Ye, Jujian] Southern Med Univ, Sch Clin Med 2, Zhujiang Hosp, 6 Chenggui Rd, Zhongshan 528403, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, PD (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Ctr Heart, Dept Cardiol, 235 Ind Ave, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wu, ZJ (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Boai Hosp Zhongshan, Dept Cardiol, 253 Ind Ave, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",2388743877@qq.com; zhangpd@smu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,18,15,,,,,3533,3543,,10.7150/ijms.62021,http://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijms.62021,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000702608300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Material and methods: An immunogenic peptide construct termed immunogenic fused PCSK9-tetanus (IFPT) was displayed on the surface of liposome nanoparticles (L-IFPT) and mixed into alum adjuvant (L-IFPTA+). The manufactured vaccine formulations IFPT, L-IFPT, L-IFPTA+, IFPTA+, and free nanoliposomes were subcutaneously injected four times with bi-weekly intervals in C57BL/6 mice on a severe atherogenic protocol. Results: Among the formulations, L-IFPTA+ vaccine was found to elicit the highest IgG response against PCSK9 peptide. The induced PCSK9 antibodies inhibited PCSK9-LDLR interaction through binding to PCSK9 in vaccinated mice. Liver low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein was increased in vaccinated mice. L-IFPTA+, L-IFPT and IFPTA+ vaccines reduced total cholesterol by up to -38.13 +/- 3.8% (p = 0.006), -23 +/- 4.1% (p = 0.027) and -19.12 +/- 3% (p = 0.038), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by up to -57 +/- 7.7% (p = 0.0003), -41.67 +/- 4.2% (p = 0.03) and -36.11 +/- 5% (p = 0.02) in hypercholesterolemic mice, respectively, versus control mice after 8 weeks. Long-term assessment indicated that the vaccine formulations could stimulate a long-lasting humoral immune response against PCSK9 peptide, which was associated with a marked reduction of total cholesterol in L-IFPTA+, L-IFPT and IFPTA+ vaccine groups by up to -82.5 +/- 7.3% (p = 0.002), -70.54 +/- 6.2% (p = 0.013) and -72.02 +/- 8.7% (p = 0.004), respectively, and LDL-C by up to -88.14 +/- 5.6% (p = 0.002), -55.92 +/- 8.3% (p = 0.003) and 54.81 +/- 9.3% (p = 0.003), respectively, versus the pre-vaccination time point adjusted to the control group.

Elevated blood cholesterol and inflammation of the endothelium are two major mechanisms contributing to the establishment of atherosclerotic plaques. Statins, such as pravastatin, are blood-cholesterol lowering drugs commonly prescribed for patients with or at risk for CVDs. In addition to lowering blood cholesterols, statins have recently been shown to improve endothelial function in both hyper- and normocholesterolemic patients with atherosclerosis. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the endothelial function improvement by statins, we assessed the RNA profile of pravastatin-treated endothelial cells, particularly their mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Methods Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with pravastatin (10 mu M) for 24 hr were profiled for lncRNAs and mRNAs using the Arraystar Human lncRNA Expression Microarray V3.0. Results Of the 30,584 different lncRNAs screened, 95 were significantly upregulated, while 86 were downregulated in HUVECs responding to pravastatin. LINC00281 and BC045663 were the most upregulated (similar to 8-fold) and downregulated (similar to 3.5-fold) lncRNAs, respectively. Of the 26,106 different mRNAs screened in the pravastatin-treated HUVEC samples, 190 were significantly upregulated, while 90 were downregulated. Assigning the differentially expressed genes by bioinformatics into functional groups revealed their molecular signaling involvement in the following physiological processes: osteoclast differentiation, Rap1 signaling pathway, hematopoiesis, immunity, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. Conclusions This is the first lncRNA and mRNA expression profiling of pravastatin-mediated changes in human endothelial cells. Our results reveal potential novel targets and mechanisms for pravastatin-mediated vascular protection in atherosclerosis.","[Singh, Shweta] Univ Western Ontario, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, London, ON, Canada; [Nguyen, Hien C.; Ehsan, Mehroz; Michels, David C.

Adiposity-associated dyslipidemia is characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and an increase in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Several factors and mechanisms are involved in lowering HDL-C levels in the obese state and HDL quantity and quality is closely related to adiponectin levels and the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate. Recent studies have shown that obesity profoundly alters HDL metabolism, resulting in altered HDL subclass distribution, composition, and function. Importantly, weight loss through gastric bypass surgery and Mediterranean diet, especially when enriched with virgin olive oil, is associated with increased HDL-C levels and significantly improved metrics of HDL function. A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms is crucial for a better understanding of the impact of obesity on lipoprotein metabolism and for the development of appropriate therapeutic approaches. The objective of this review article was to summarize the newly identified changes in the metabolism, composition, and function of HDL in obesity and to discuss possible pathophysiological consequences.","[Stadler, Julia T.; Marsche, Gunther] Med Univ Graz, Otto Loewi Res Ctr, Div Pharmacol, A-8010 Graz, Austria",,"Stadler, JT; Marsche, G (corresponding author), Med Univ Graz, Otto Loewi Res Ctr, Div Pharmacol, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",julia.stadler@medunigraz.at; gunther.marsche@medunigraz.at,,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,21,23,,,,,,,8985,10.3390/ijms21238985,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21238985,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000597514800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is projected that approximately 35 million tonnes of milk fat will be produced globally by 2025. This surplus, enhances the need for diversification of milk fat products and the milk pool in general. Infant milk formula producers, for instance, have incorporated enzyme modified (humanised) milk fat and fat globule phospholipids to better mimic human milk fat structures. Minor components like mono- and di-glycerides from milk fat are increasingly utilized as emulsifiers, replacing palm esters in premium-priced food products. This review examines the chemistry of milk fat and the technologies employed for its modification, fractionation and enrichment. Emerging processing technologies such as ultrasound, high pressure processing, supercritical fluid extraction and fractionation, can be employed to improve the nutritional and functional attributes of milk fat. The potential of recent developments in biological intervention, through dietary manipulation of milk fatty acid profiles in cattle also offers significant promise.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the promotion of the FBRs for improving dietary practices and nutrient intakes. Methods and Study Design: A community-based, clustered-randomized trial was conducted among Minangkabau women of reproductive age (20-44 years) with dyslipidemia. The subjects were assigned either into the FBR group (n=48), or the non-FBR group (n=54). Baseline and end-line dietary data were assessed through interviews using a one-week semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQ-FFQ) and two replicate 24-hour dietary recalls. The changes in dietary practice and nutrient intakes were analysed using ANCOVA test. Results: Significant changes were observed (p<0.005) in the consumption of the promoted food items and subgroups (sea fish, soy protein, dark green leafy vegetables, and potatoes). Significant changes were also observed in nutrient intake, especially energy intake from carbohydrates and unsaturated fatty acids (total PUFA, MUFA, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids), as well as the dietary P/S ratio and fiber intake. Conclusions: With current dietary practices, intakes of some typical problem nutrients such as n-6, zinc, iron, and fiber still could not achieve 100% of the RNIs, while the intake of SFA still exceeded the recommended intake.

In the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT), the addition of 4 g IPE daily resulted in a 25% reduction in cardiovascular events beyond statins and other standard of care therapies. IPE is now the only therapy currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with elevated TGs (150-499 mg/dL) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or Type 2 diabetes mellitus and two or more CVD risk factors. Areas covered: IPE is a highly purified form of eicosapentanoic acid for patients with elevated TGs as monotherapy or combined with statins and/or other lipid lowering therapies. The REDUCE-IT Study demonstrated a 25% reduction in the primary outcome measure and 30% reduction in total CVD events in high-risk patients with elevated TGs (135-499 mg/dL) assigned to IPE (4 g daily). Side effects included a statistically significant increased risk of atrial fibrillation and bleeding, although the risk of stroke was reduced and there were no cases of fatal bleeding. The FDA recently approved IPE for treatment of patients with TG levels of 150-499 mg/dL and preexisting CVD or Type 2 diabetes mellitus with two or more risk factors. Expert opinion: IPE has proven to be superior to other forms of omega 3 fatty acid in reducing CVD risk in patients with elevated TG. This could be attributed to multiple factors including the use of highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl esters without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), thus preventing the increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with DHA especially at high TG levels, reduction in atherogenic TG-rich particles, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, improvement in endothelial function, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque.","[Bazarbashi, Najdat] Univ Maryland, Dept Med, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Miller, Michael] Univ Maryland, Div Cardiovasc Med, Sch Med, 110 S Paca St,Suite 7-124, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",,"Miller, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Div Cardiovasc Med, Sch Med, 110 S Paca St,Suite 7-124, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",mmiller@som.umaryland.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2020,18,4,,,,,175,180,,10.1080/14779072.2020.1749596,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2020.1749596,,APR 2020,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000525110400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is high among patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events (CVE) remain the leading cause of death after kidney transplantation (KT). We performed a retrospective analysis of 389 KT recipients to assess if the European Society of Cardiology Score (ESC-Score), Framingham Heart Study Score (FRAMINGHAM), Prospective Cardiovascular Munster Study Score (PROCAM-Score) or Assessing cardiovascular risk using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Score (ASSIGN-Score) algorithms can predict cardiovascular risk after KT at the time of entering the waiting list. Methods. 389 KT candidates were scored by the time of entering the waiting list. Pearsons chi-square test, cox regression analysis and survival estimates were performed to evaluate the reliability of the cardiovascular scoring models after successful KT. Results. During a follow-up of 8 +/- 5.8 years, 96 patients (30%) died due to cardiovascular problems, whereas 13.9% suffered non-fatal CVE. Graft loss occurred in 84 patients (21.6%). Predictors of CVE, survival and graft loss were age and the length of end-stage kidney disease. All scores performed well in assessing the risk for CVE (P < 0.01). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis using the ESC-SCORE, as an example, suggested a cut-off for risk stratification and clinical decisions. Conclusions. We found all tested scores were reliable for cardiovascular assessment. We suggest using cardiac scores for risk assessment before KT and then taking further steps according to current guidelines.","[Herzog, Anna Laura] Univ Wurzburg, Div Nephrol, Transplantat Zentrum, Wurzburg, Germany; [Kalogirou, Charis] Julius Maximilians Univ, Dept Urol & Pediat Urol, Med Sch, Wurzburg, Germany; [Wanner, Christoph; Lopau, Kai] Univ Wurzburg, Med Klin 1, Div Nephrol, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Herzog, AL (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Div Nephrol, Transplantat Zentrum, Wurzburg, Germany.",Herzog_A1@ukw.de,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,13,2,,,,,150,158,,10.1093/ckj/sfz041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfz041,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000553181700006,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Ding, M; Rexrode, KM",,,,"Ding, Ming; Rexrode, Kathryn M.",,,A Review of Lipidomics of Cardiovascular Disease Highlights the Importance of Isolating Lipoproteins,METABOLITES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Cutting-edge lipidomic profiling measures hundreds or even thousands of lipids in plasma and is increasingly used to investigate mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, we introduce lipidomic techniques, describe distributions of lipids across lipoproteins, and summarize findings on the association of lipids with CVD based on lipidomics. The main findings of 16 cohort studies were that, independent of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), ceramides (d18:1/16:0, d18:1/18:0, and d18:1/24:1) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) containing saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains are positively associated with risks of CVD outcomes, while PCs containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains (PUFA) are inversely associated with risks of CVD outcomes. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) may be positively associated with risks of CVD outcomes. Interestingly, the distributions of the identified lipids vary across lipoproteins: LPCs are primarily contained in HDLs, ceramides are mainly contained in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and PCs are distributed in both HDLs and LDLs. Thus, the potential mechanism behind previous findings may be related to the effect of the identified lipids on the biological functions of HDLs and LDLs. Only eight studies on the lipidomics of HDL and non-HDL particles and CVD outcomes have been conducted, which showed that higher triglycerides (TAGs), lower PUFA, lower phospholipids, and lower sphingomyelin content in HDLs might be associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the generalizability of these studies is a major concern, given that they used case-control or cross-sectional designs in hospital settings, included a very small number of participants, and did not correct for multiple testing or adjust for blood lipids such as HDL-c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), or TAGs. Overall, findings from the literature highlight the importance of research on lipidomics of lipoproteins to enhance our understanding of the mechanism of the association between the identified lipids and the risk of CVD and allow the identification of novel lipid biomarkers in HDLs and LDLs, independent of HDL-c and LDL-c. Lipidomic techniques show the feasibility of this exciting research direction, and the lack of high-quality epidemiological studies warrants well-designed prospective cohort studies.","[Ding, Ming] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rexrode, Kathryn M.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Womens Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Ding, M (corresponding author), Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mid829@mail.harvard.edu; KREXRODE@bwh.harvard.edu,,,,,,,,35,35,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,10,4,,,,,,,163,10.3390/metabo10040163,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo10040163,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000533907300034,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Parolini, C",,,,"Parolini, Cinzia",,,A Compendium of the Biological Effects of Apolipoprotein A-I-Milano,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Obesity is a pathologic condition generated by an energy imbalance, that is, excess caloric consumption, leading to weight gain and metabolic disturbances characterized by adipose tissue inflammation and hyperglycemic conditions. In line with these observations, increasing evidence causally links inflammation, or the molecules and networks integral to inflammatory response, to the development of obesity and the complications that emerge from this pathology, such as cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, and metabolic illnesses, as well as sepsis and cancer. Not surprisingly, this chronic and abnormal metabolic background leads to constant derangements in innate and adaptive immunity. It is well known that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and various studies have highlighted an emerging role of HDL in modulating immune function. The efficacy of synthetic HDL (sHDL) containing the recombinant form of apoA-I-Milano (sHDL-apoA-I-M), originating from the observation that carriers of this mutation have low levels of HDL cholesterol without increased atherosclerosis, has been largely proved in diverse animal models of atherosclerosis; however, the therapeutic use of sHDL-apoA-I-M still needs clinical validation. One of the main limitations to the use of recombinant proteins in clinical studies lies in the unsustainable purification costs. Unpurified rice-milk-apoA-I-M demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties in a mouse model, even though administrated by an unconventional way: by oral gavage. Additionally, recent data have uncovered new therapeutic applications for this sHDL-apoA-I-M. This review provides an overview of all potential application of sHDL-apoA-I-M in some inflammatory-based diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A recent study demonstrated that oral administration of rice-seed protein extracts containing the apoA-I-M (i.e., the milk-apoAI(M)) reduced atherosclerosis development in a mouse model. Moreover, the rice-milk-apoA-IM preserved both in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties, as observed when sHDLapoA-I-M was given by intravascular infusion. Besides, various studies suggested that sHDL-apoA-I-M could positively affect other inflammatory-based diseases. Together, these data might represent a new starting point for sHDL-apoA-I-M-based therapies in chronic degenerative disease.","[Parolini, Cinzia] Univ Milan, Dept Pharmacol & Biomol Sci, Via Balzaretti 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy",,"Parolini, C (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Pharmacol & Biomol Sci, Via Balzaretti 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",cinzia.parolini@unimi.it,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1,2020,372,1,,,,,54,62,,10.1124/jpet.119.261719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/jpet.119.261719,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000507945200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have identified the association between the P376L missense mutation of the SCARB1 gene with increased serum HDL-Cholesterol level. However, the contribution of this variant to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. Objective: We have investigated the association between the P376L polymorphism with the properties of HDL and CVD outcomes in a population sample recruited as part of the Mashhad-Stroke and Heart-Atherosclerotic-Disorders (MASHAD) cohort. Methods: Six hundred and fifteen individuals who had a median follow-up period of 7 years were recruited as part of the MASHAD cohort. Anthropometric, biochemical parameters and HDL lipid peroxidation (HDLox) were assessed. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan-real-time-PCR based method. The association of P376L-rs74830766 with cardiovascular-risk-factors and CVD events were evaluated. Results: Carriers of the P376L variant were significantly more likely than non-carriers to develop CVD using multivariate analyses adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors defined as: age, sex, BMI, presence of diabetes, or hypertension, positive smoking habit, and total cholesterol (OR: 3.75, 95%CI: 1.76-7.98, p = 0.001). In an adjusted model, there was a two fold increase in cardiovascular endpoints among individuals who were heterozygous for the P376L variant (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.12-to 3.84, p = 0.02). Although there was no association between the presence of the P376L variant and HDL-C level, serum HDLox, measured as dysfunctional HDL, was 13% higher among carriers of the P376L variant than non-carriers.

Many chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients have the traditional CVD risk factors (age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia); however, CKD and dialysis predispose patients to several non-traditional risk factors, including myocardial remodeling, hyperparathyroidism, malnutrition, bone and mineral disorders, anemia, albuminuria, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Interestingly, as both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increase and renal function declines, the therapeutic benefits of lipid-lowering agents decrease significantly. However, their recognized reduction in cardiovascular events and excellent tolerability contribute to the frequent use of lipid-lowering agents. Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Recent post hoc analyses of the lipid lowering in patients with CKD indicate that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may provide long-term cardiovascular protection in patients with CKD stages I-IV. However, questions remain regarding the optimal role of lipid-lowering agents for primary prevention in patients on dialysis. Statins remain the preferred first-line pharmacologic therapy, but non-statin add-on therapies can be used to decrease the overall risk of CVD in the CKD population, though evidence supporting each agent in CKD is limited.

It is typically the culmination of a long and complex process where the formation of an occlusive thrombus within a coronary artery leads to cardiac ischemia and infarction. Atherosclerosis-the primary underlying disease process-begins in early adulthood and is driven by lipid accumulation in the arterial wall, inflammation, and vascular injury. As it progresses, some plaques evolve to take on a more unstable phenotype with greater degrees of inflammation. Eventually, plaque rupture can occur, and contact of blood with the exposed subendothelial matrix and plaque content causes the formation of occlusive thrombi. This cascade of events leads to the clinical manifestation of MI with angina pectoris, myocyte death, and ultimately, impaired cardiac function. Other coronary artery pathologies such as plaque erosion or spontaneous coronary artery dissection can also cause MI, although their frequency compared with plaque rupture is unclear and controversial, mainly based on a surprisingly low number of autopsy studies available. Preventing and treating MI faces several challenges, and there is the need for thorough research and hopefully breakthroughs in several areas. This includes research on the mechanisms driving plaque instability and causing MI, identification of the patient at risk of MI, identification of plaques that are vulnerable, developing approaches for plaque stabilization, and finally if MI occurs, the treatment/prevention of thrombotic occlusions, as well as preventing ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This highlight article shines light on recent high-quality articles published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology and illustrates the groundbreaking work taking place in these areas of research and the promise it holds for patients in preventing or treating MI.","[Palasubramaniam, Jathushan; Wang, Xiaowei; Peter, Karlheinz] Baker Heart & Diabet Inst, Atherothrombosis & Vasc Biol Lab, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Palasubramaniam, Jathushan; Wang, Xiaowei; Peter, Karlheinz] Monash Univ, Dept Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Palasubramaniam, Jathushan; Peter, Karlheinz] Alfred Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Peter, K (corresponding author), Baker Heart & Diabet Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",karlheinz.peter@baker.edu.au,,,,,,,,33,33,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,39,8,,,,,E176,E185,,10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.312578,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000480746200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent discoveries in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revealed a significant impact of HDL on pulmonary artery vasoreactivity and patients' prognosis. The vasoprotective activity of HDL primarily involves vascular endothelium that also plays a central role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pathobiology. However, the exact mechanism in which this lipoprotein fraction exerts its effect in pulmonary circulation is still under investigation.

J,"Baum, SJ; Scholz, KP",,,,"Baum, Seth J.; Scholz, Kenneth P.",,,Rounding the corner on residual risk: Implications of REDUCE-IT for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids treatment in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease remain at increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events even during optimal lipid-lowering therapy. Recent studies using the methods of Mendelian randomization, as well as analyses of data from large statin trials, have concluded that elevated triglyceride (TG) levels contribute to that increased risk. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) from fish and shellfish (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) reduce TG levels when added to the diet in sufficient amounts, and they have favorable effects on several other markers of CV risk. However, trials of omega-3 PUFAs have had inconsistent findings regarding CV risk reduction. Recently, the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA-Intervention Trial) trial reported that treatment of such high-risk patients with icosapent ethyl, a purified and stabilized ethyl ester of EPA, reduced the risk of the trial's primary CV endpoint by 25% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 32%-17%; P < .001). To appreciate the clinical implications of this result, it is important to understand how the REDUCE-IT trial differed from previous trials, especially with regard to patient enrollment criteria and treatment dosing. We discuss these design features relative to other trials. TG lowering can account for only part of the risk reduction seen with icosapent ethyl; we also consider other potential contributory mechanisms.","[Baum, Seth J.] Excel Med Clin Trials, 7900 Glades Rd Ste 400, Boca Raton, FL 33434 USA; [Baum, Seth J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Integrated Med Sci, Charles E Schmidt Coll Med, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",,"Baum, SJ (corresponding author), Excel Med Clin Trials, 7900 Glades Rd Ste 400, Boca Raton, FL 33434 USA.",sjbaum@fpim.org,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,42,9,,,,,829,838,,10.1002/clc.23220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clc.23220,,JUN 2019,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000473919300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the major risk factors of ASCVD is dyslipidemia and all the available guidelines suggest the importance of strategies for lipid control in a remarkable proportion of the general population. Areas covered: This review focuses on the therapeutic options available for the management of lipid disorders in adults. Expert opinion: A large body of evidence supports that statins are still the first-line option for the management of hypercholesterolemia in a large percentage of patients. Statins should be given at the appropriate dose and considering the differences in lipid-lowering potency across the different medications. The main current challenge in the treatment of lipid disorders is the need of improving patient adherence and persistence to lipid-lowering treatments beyond the drug choice and the target lipid component. To achieve this goal, the best strategy would be to treat the patients by using the appropriate drugs given at adequate doses to reach the treatment target. We should also avoid drug interactions, monitor possible untoward side effects and promote adherence to treatment by tailoring treatment strategies to each patient.","[Cicero, Arrigo F.

However, these regions are enriched for the regulatory enhancers specific to the cells relevant to the specific trait. Indeed, many of the GWAS loci that have been functionally characterized lie within enhancers that regulate expression levels of key genes. In order to identify polymorphisms with potential allele-specific regulatory effects, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline that harnesses epigenetic signatures as well as transcription factor (TF) binding motifs to identify putative enhancers containing a SNP with potential allele-specific TF binding in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a GWAS-identified SNP. We applied the approach to GWAS findings for blood lipids, revealing 7 putative enhancers harboring associated SNPs, 3 of which lie within the introns of LCAT and ABCA1, genes that play crucial roles in cholesterol biogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism. All 3 enhancers demonstrated allele-specific in vitro regulatory activity in liver-derived cell lines. We demonstrated that these putative enhancers are in close physical proximity to the promoters of their respective genes, in situ, likely through chromatin looping. In addition, the associated alleles altered the likelihood of transcription activator STAT3 binding. Our results demonstrate that through our approach, the LD blocks that contain GWAS signals, often hundreds of kilobases in size with multiple SNPs serving as statistical proxies to the true functional site, can provide an experimentally testable hypothesis for the underlying regulatory mechanism linking genetic variants to complex traits.","[Howard, Alicia D.; Wang, Xiaochun; Prasad, Megana; Chang, Yen-Pei Christy] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Nutr & Diabet, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Das Sahu, Avinash; Aniba, Radhouane; Hannenhalli, Sridhar] Univ Maryland, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Miller, Michael] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Prevent Cardiol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",,"Chang, YPC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Nutr & Diabet, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",cchang@som.umaryland.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,APR 30,2019,14,4,,,,,,,e0215911,10.1371/journal.pone.0215911,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215911,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000466364800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sixty former professional football players aged 40-50 years and who ended their sports career at least ten years ago were recruited for the study and grouped into two groups based on their physical activity habits after their retirement. Health and lifestyle characteristics were collected through a questionnaire to obtain information about recreational physical activity levels, diseases, family medical history, smoking, alcohol intake and dietary habits. Furthermore, lung functions, blood parameters and cardiovascular health were evaluated. Our results showed that body weight and body fat percentage were significantly higher in retired footballers who had a sedentary lifestyle compared to those who were physically active. The absolute and predicted values for forced expiratory volume in one-second values were higher in the active group. Twelve retired athletes were found to have intraventricular conduction delay. The findings suggest that former footballers who have higher levels of physical activity have advanced body composition, respiratory functions and serum lipids compared to former footballers with less active lifestyles. It is recommended that former elite athletes should maintain physically active lifestyles to sustain their health and reduce the risk of disease and disability in the later years of life.","[Melekoglu, Tuba; Sezgin, Erdi; Isin, Ali] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Sports Sci, Dept Trainer Educ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey; [Turk, Aysen] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Sports Med, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",,"Melekoglu, T (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Fac Sports Sci, Dept Trainer Educ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",tubasn@hotmail.com; sezginerdi@hotmail.com; isin_ali@hotmail.com; draysenturk@gmail.com,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,7,4,,,,,,,75,10.3390/sports7040075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sports7040075,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000467285400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS, to identify studies investigating n-3 fatty acids as a preventative or therapeutic agent for the attenuation of PCOS complications. Subsequently, the impact of omega-3 on PCOS, omega-3 and inflammation, omega-3 and insulin resistance, omega-3 and adipokines, omega-3 and lipid metabolism, omega-3 and endothelial function and omega-3 and hormonal factors were discussed. There are multiple mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs may exert their beneficial effects on PCOS, including anti-obesity, glycemic and hormonal hemostasis, anti-inflammatory, regulation of adipokine production and enhancement of endothelial function. N-3 PUFAs are a promising agent in relieving complications associated with PCOS. Although most of the studies in patients with PCOS reported an improvement in most complications after administration of omega-3 supplements, there is a distinct dearth of studies investigating the dietary intake of these types of fatty acids. Moreover, favorable effects regarding the improvement of dyslipidemia, regulation of adipokines, regulation of hormonal factors and enhancement of endothelial function are limited.

To date, no genetic study has investigated the cause of low HDL-C in the Lebanese population. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the genetic causes for hypoalphalipoproteinemia in a Lebanese family with extremely low HDL-C levels. METHODS: We sequenced the ABCA1 gene and evaluated cholesterol efflux, inflammatory, and metabolic profiles in the proband and his family. RESULTS: We identified the first Lebanese pathogenic variant in ABCA1 gene causing Tangier disease in a consanguineous family. The proband carried a novel homozygous pathogenic variant p.Gly592Asp in exon 14 of ABCA1, which segregated with the disease in the family. Functional study of the p.Gly592Asp pathogenic variant revealed that lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I dependent cholesterol efflux was completely abolished in cholesterol-loaded human monocytes-derived macrophages isolated from the proband when compared to controls. Systemic inflammatory and metabolic assessments showed that plasma cytokines (MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, IL-6, CRP, TNF-alpha), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin), inflammatory soluble receptors (sIL-6r, sTNFRI, sTNFRII), and metabolic markers (Insulin, C-peptide) were elevated in the proband when compared to controls. Noninvasive cardiovascular investigation revealed the presence of premature artery lesions in the pro band. CONCLUSIONS: It is the first case of Tangier disease reported in Lebanon harboring a novel pathogenic variant in ABCA1. Further genetic research is needed in the Middle East where the consanguinity rate is elevated, to understand the cause of the highly prevalent dyslipidemia.

HDL is slowly emerging from these dark times due to the HDL flux hypothesis wherein measures of HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) are better predictors of reduced CVD risk than static HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. HDL particles are emulsions of metabolites, lipids, protein, and microRNA (miR) built on the backbone of Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) that are growing in their complexity due to the higher sensitivity of the respective omic technologies. Our understanding of particle composition has increased dramatically within this era and has exposed how our understanding of these particles to date has been oversimplified. Elucidation of the HDL proteome coupled with the identification of specific miRs on HDL have highlighted the hormonal characteristics of HDL in that it carries and delivers messages systemically. HDL can dock to most peripheral cells via its receptors, including SR-B1, ABCA1, and ABCG1, which may be a critical step for facilitating HDL-to-cell communication. The composition of HDL particles is, in turn, altered in numerous disease states including diabetes, auto-immune disease, and CVD. The consequence of changes in composition, however, on subsequent biological activities of HDL is currently poorly understood and this is an important avenue for the field to explore in the future. Improving HDL particle quality as opposed to HDL quantity may, in turn, prove a more beneficial investment to reduce CVD risk.","[Kajani, Sarina; Curley, Sean; McGillicuddy, Fiona C.] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Conway Inst, Cardiometab Res Grp, Diabet Complicat Res Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland",,"McGillicuddy, FC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Conway Inst, Cardiometab Res Grp, Diabet Complicat Res Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland.",sarina.kajani@ucdconnect.ie; sean.curley@ucdconnect.ie; fiona.mcgillicuddy@ucd.ie,,,,,,,,34,36,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018,19,7,,,,,,,1971,10.3390/ijms19071971,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms19071971,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000442807400150,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comprised a main study and an extension study. In the main study, the efficacy and safety of a combination of rosuvastatin (5, 10, and 20 mg) with ezetimibe (10 mg) were compared with those of rosuvastatin (5, 10, and 20 mg) alone. The subjects who achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal in the main study and agreed to a further study were enrolled for the extension study. In the extension study, ezetimibe 10 mg was also administered to subjects who had received rosuvastatin (5, 10, and 20 mg) alone in the main study, and the same treatment was continued for subjects who had received a combination of rosuvastatin with ezetimibe in the main study. Findings: At the end of the main study (week 8), LDL-C levels were significantly lower in subjects receiving combination therapy than in those receiving rosuvastatin monotherapy. Other lipid profiles also significantly improved in the combination therapy group. These improvements continued in the extension study. The combination therapy of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. At the end of the main study, more subjects achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group. The increased dosage of rosuvastatin was also well tolerated in the combination treatment.

The evidence supporting the safety of extremely low LDL levels comes from genetic studies and clinical drug trials. Individuals with lifelong low LDL levels due to mutations in genes associated with increased LDL-LDL receptor (LDLR) activity reveal no safety issues. Patients achieving extremely low LDL levels in the IMPROVE-IT and FOURIER, and the PROFICIO and ODYSSEY programs seem not to have an increased prevalence of adverse effects. The main concern regarding extremely low LDL-C plasma concentrations is the adequacy of the supply of cholesterol, and other molecules, to peripheral tissues. However, LDL proteomic and kinetic studies reaffirm that LDL is the final product of endogenous lipoprotein metabolism. Four of 5 LDL particles are cleared through the LDL-LDLR pathway in the liver. Given that mammalian cells have no enzymatic systems to degrade cholesterol, the LDL-LDLR pathway is the main mechanism for removal of cholesterol from the body. Our focus, therefore, is to review, from a physiological perspective, why such extremely low LDL-C concentrations do not appear to be detrimental. We suggest that extremely low LDL-C levels due to increased LDLR activity may be a surrogate of adequate LDL-LDLR pathway function. (C) 2018 National Lipid Association.

Here, we review recent discoveries from human genome studies using new analytic tools as well as relevant animal studies that have both addressed, and in some cases, fueled this controversy. Recent Findings Methodologic developments in genotyping and sequencing, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), exome sequencing, and exome array genotyping, have been applied to the study of HDL-C and risk of CHD in large, multi-ethnic populations. Some of these efforts focused on population-wide variation in common variants have uncovered new polymorphisms at novel loci associated with HDL-C and, in some cases, CHD risk. Other efforts have discovered loss-of-function variants for the first time in genes previously implicated in HDL metabolism through common variant studies or animal models. These studies have allowed the genetic relationship between these pathways, HDL-C and CHD to be explored in humans for the first time through analysis tools such as Mendelian randomization. We explore these discoveries for selected key HDL-C genes CETP, LCAT, LIPG, SCARB1, and novel loci implicated from GWAS including GALNT2, KLF14, and TTC39B. Summary Recent human genetics findings have identified new nodes regulating HDL metabolism while reshaping our current understanding of known candidate genes to HDL and CHD risk through the study of critical variants across model systems. Despite their effect on HDL-C, variants in many of the reviewed genes were found to lack any association with CHD. These data collectively indicate that HDL-C concentration, which represents a static picture of a very dynamic and heterogeneous metabolic milieu, is unlikely to be itself causally protective against CHD. In this context, human genetics represent an extremely valuable tool to further explore the biological mechanisms regulating HDL metabolism and investigate what role, if any, HDL plays in the pathogenesis of CHD.","[Vitali, Cecilia; Khetarpal, Sumeet A.; Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, 11-162 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Genet, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Med, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rader, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Inst Translat Med & Therapeut, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Rader, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, 11-162 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Rader, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Genet, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Rader, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Med, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Rader, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Inst Translat Med & Therapeut, 11-125 TRC,3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",cevitali@mail.med.upenn.edu; sumeetak@mail.med.upenn.edu; rader@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,61,62,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 4,2017,19,12,,,,,,,132,10.1007/s11886-017-0940-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11886-017-0940-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000414502800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We sought to understand the relationship between HDL-C levels and subsequent non-fatal clinical events. Methods Individuals without prior cardiovascular disease or cancer were identified. Outcomes of interest were classified as non-fatal cardiovascular, cancer and infectious. Sex-stratified, multivariable, cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were created. The reference level HDL-C for both women and men was 51-60 mg/dL. Results Our cohort consisted of 631 762 individuals. For cardiovascular events, there was a consistent inverse relationship, with higher adjusted HRs for the lower HDL-C strata in both men and women. This relationship was also seen in the composite of non-cardiovascular outcomes. In women, the HR in the <30 mg/dL HDL-C category was 2.10 (95% CI 1.66 to 2.57) and 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.72) for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes, respectively; in contrast, in the >90 mg/dL group, it was 0.87 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.02) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.06).

It presents the significance of cardiovascular diseases and addresses major questions currently being discussed among lipidologists and the current thinking with respect to low LDL-cholesterol levels and HDL. It provides an overview of the period during which lipid-modifying drugs were introduced and their relevance with respect to cardiovascular outcome data and lists possible reasons why some patients develop new cardiovascular events while being treated with statins. Especially impressive is the history of the appearance of the PCSK9 inhibitors on the market - only 12 years after PCSK9 was detected; a study completed in 2017 provides evidence about the cardiovascular effects of these new drugs. Other new drugs are also mentioned: mipomersen, lomitapide, and Alipogen Tiparvovec. Some promising drugs are still in the pipeline which inhibit the synthesis of apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein(a), and the PCSK9 protein. During the 1970s, specific lipoprotein apheresis began to be used in high-risk patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, severe hypercholesterolemia and elevated Lipoprotein(a) levels and this review provides evidence of the effectiveness of the extracorporeal therapy with respect to the reduction of cardiovascular events. Particularly in patients with high Lipoprotein(a) levels, apheresis has been proven capable of reducing cardiovascular events by more than 80%.

Intervention studies with statins have shown to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations and subsequently the risk of developing CHD. However, not all the aggressive statin therapy could decrease the risk of developing CHD. Many clinical and epidemiological studies have clearly demonstrated that the HDL cholesterol is inversely associated with risk of CHD and is a critical and independent component of predicting this risk. Elucidations of HDL metabolism give rise to therapeutic targets with potential to raising plasma HDL cholesterol levels, thereby reducing the risk of developing CHD. The concept of reverse cholesterol transport is based on the hypothesis that HDL displays an cardioprotective function, which is a process involved in the removal of excess cholesterol that is accumulated in the peripheral tissues (e.g., macrophages in the aortae) by HDL, transporting it to the liver for excretion into the feces via the bile. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the role of the lymphatic route in reverse cholesterol transport, as well as the biliary and the non-biliary pathways for removal of cholesterol from the body. These studies will greatly increase the likelihood of discovering new lipid-lowering drugs, which are more effective in the prevention and therapeutic intervention of CHD that is the major cause of human death and disability worldwide.","[Wang, Helen H.; Wang, David Q. -H.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Liver Dis, Marion Bessin Liver Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Garruti, Gabriella] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Sch Med, Endocrinol Sect, Dept Emergency & Organ Transplantat, Piazza G Cesare 11, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Liu, Min] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Cincinnati, OH 45237 USA; [Portincasa, Piero] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Biomed Sci & Human Oncol, Clin Med A Murri, Sch Med, Bari, Italy",,"Wang, DQH (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Liver Dis, Marion Bessin Liver Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",david.wang@einstein.yu.edu,,,,,,,,88,99,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,16,,,1,,,S27,S42,,10.5604/01.3001.0010.5495,http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0010.5495,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000460734300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this review is to summarize the literature and to provide an updated overview of the effects of n-3 PUFAs on key players in RCT, including apoliprotein AI (apoA-I), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, apoE, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and ABCG5/G8.

However genetic polymophisms linked to HDL-C do not associate consistently with CVD risk, and randomized clinical studies of drugs that elevate HDL-C via different mechanisms failed to reduce CVD risk in statin treated patients with established CVD. New metrics that capture HDL's proposed carchoprotectwe effects are therefore urgently needed. Recent findings Recent studies demonstrate cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of serum HDL (serum depleted of cholesterol rich atherogenic lipoproteins) is an independent and better predictor of incident and prevalent CVD risk than HDL-C. However, it remains unclear whether therapies that increase CEC are cardioprotective. Other key issues are the impact of HDL-targeted therapies on HDL particle size and concentration and the relationship of those changes to CEC and cardioprotection. Summary It is time to end the clinical focus on HDLC and to understand how HDL's function, protein composition and size contribute to CVD risk. It will also be important to link variations in function and size to HDL-argeted therapies. Developing new metrics for quantifying HDL function, based on better understanding HDL metabolism and macrophage CEC, is critical for achieving these goals.","[Ronsein, Graziella E.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Bioquim, Inst Quim, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Heinecke, Jay W.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA USA",,"Ronsein, GE (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Bioquim, Inst Quim, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",ronsein@iq.usp.br,,,,,,,,28,28,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,28,5,,,,,414,418,,10.1097/MOL.0000000000000446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0000000000000446,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000408982000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

There have been many exciting advances in lipid management over the recent years. This review discusses these recent advances as well as the direction of future studies.Recent findingsSeveral recent clinical trials support low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) reduction beyond maximal statin therapy for improved cardiovascular outcomes. Ezetimibe reduced LDL-c beyond maximal statin therapy and was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes for high-risk populations. Further LDL-c reduction may also be achieved with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibition and a recent trial, Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER), was the first to show reduction in cardiovascular events for evolocumab. Additional outcome studies of monoclonal antibody and RNA-targeted PCSK9 inhibitors are underway. Quantitative high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) improvements have failed to have clinical impact to date; most recently, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors and apolipoprotein infusions have demonstrated disappointing results. There are still ongoing trials in both of these areas, but some newer therapies are focusing on HDL functionality and not just the absolute HDL-c levels. There are several ongoing studies in triglyceride reduction including fatty acid therapy, inhibition of apolipoprotein C-3 or ANGTPL3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- agonists.SummaryLipid management continues to evolve and these advances have the potential to change clinical practice in the coming years.","[Kampangkaew, June; Pickett, Stephen; Nambi, Vijay] Baylor Coll Med, Michael E DeBakey Vet Affairs Hosp, Dept Med, Div Atherosclerosis & Vasc Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kampangkaew, June; Pickett, Stephen; Nambi, Vijay] Methodist Hosp, Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vasc Ctr, 6535 Fannin, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Nambi, Vijay] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, 6565 Fannin St,MS A601 STE B160, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Nambi, V (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, 6565 Fannin St,MS A601 STE B160, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",vnambi@bcm.tmc.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2017,32,4,,,,,348,355,,10.1097/HCO.0000000000000415,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000000415,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000403086200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Statins may be considered for patients with elevated 10-year risk (>5%) or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater. Objective: To describe the prevalence of elevated ASCVD risk among nondiabetic adults younger than 50 years. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1999 to 2000 through 2011 to 2012. Participants: Adults aged 30 to 49 years without known ASCVD or diabetes. Measurements: 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated by using the 2013 ACC/AHA ASCVD risk calculator. Participants were subdivided by age, sex, and history of smoking and hypertension. The percentages of adults in each subgroup with a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than 5% and of those with an LDL-C level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater were estimated. Low-prevalence subgroups were defined as those in which a greater than 1% prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk could be ruled out (that is, the upper 95% confidence bound for prevalence was <= 1%). Results: Overall, 9608 NHANES participants representing 67.9 million adults were included, with approximately half (47.12%, representing 32 million adults) in low-prevalence subgroups. In the absence of smoking or hypertension, 0.09% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.35%) of adult men younger than 40 years and 0.04% (CI, 0.0% to 0.26%) of adult women younger than 50 years had an elevated risk. Among other subgroups, 0% to 75.9% of participants had an increased risk. Overall, 2.9% (CI, 2.3% to 3.5%) had an LDL-C level of 4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or greater. Limitation: No information was available regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusion: In the absence of risk factors, the prevalence of increased ASCVD risk is low among women younger than 50 and men younger than 40 years.","[Patel, Krishna K.] Univ Missouri Kansas City, St Lukes Hosp Kansas City, Mid Amer Heart Inst, Dept Cardiol, 4401 Wornall,9th Floor CV Res, Kansas City, MO 64111 USA; [Taksler, Glen B.; Hu, Bo; Rothberg, Michael B.] Cleveland Clin, Ctr Value Based Care Res, Inst Med, 9500 Euclid Ave,Desk G-10, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",,"Patel, KK (corresponding author), Univ Missouri Kansas City, St Lukes Hosp Kansas City, Mid Amer Heart Inst, Dept Cardiol, 4401 Wornall,9th Floor CV Res, Kansas City, MO 64111 USA.",patelkris@umkc.edu,,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 20,2017,166,12,,,,,876,+,,10.7326/M16-2052,http://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M16-2052,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000403579000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

They contain high quality protein and several nutrients with potential health benefits. Nevertheless, the appearance of cardiovascular disease as an important public health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, along with the identification of high blood cholesterol levels as a risk factor for this disease, was responsible for the advice to limit dietary cholesterol (and, therefore, eggs) that was promoted by health care professionals and institutions during the 70s. To date, several cohort studies show that the intake of one egg a day does not increase cardiovascular risk in the general population. However, this evidence is not clear among diabetic patients, and raises the question whether its consumption in large quantities is entirely safe in this particular population. Additionally, intervention studies have shown that egg consumption does not adversely affect cardiovascular risk factors neither in healthy individuals nor in those with cardiometabolic disease. Moreover, these studies suggest that the incorporation of egg to the diet could bring additional benefits such as promoting a less atherogenic lipid profile.","[Dussaillant, Catalina; Echeverria, Guadalupe; Rigotti, Attilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Nutr Mol & Enfermedades Cron, Santiago, Chile; [Rozowski, Jaime; Velasco, Nicolas; Arteaga, Antonio; Rigotti, Attilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Med, Dept Nutr Diabet & Metab, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago 8330024, Chile",,"Rigotti, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Med, Dept Nutr Diabet & Metab, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago 8330024, Chile.",arigotti@med.puc.cl,,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-JUN,2017,34,3,,,,,710,718,,10.20960/nh.473,http://dx.doi.org/10.20960/nh.473,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000404498400031,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVES This study sought to reappraise the association of HDL-C level with CV and non-CV mortality using a big data approach. METHODS An observational cohort study was conducted using the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) dataset, which was created by linking together 17 different individual-level data sources. People were included if they were between 40 and 105 years old on January 1, 2008, living in Ontario, Canada, without previous CV conditions or severe comorbidities, and had an outpatient fasting cholesterol measurement in the year prior to the inception date. The primary outcome was cause-specific mortality. RESULTS A total of 631,762 individuals were included. The mean age of our cohort was 57.2 years, 55.4% were women, and mean HDL-C level was 55.2 mg/dl. There were 17,952 deaths during a mean follow-up of 4.9 +/- 0.4 years. The overall all-cause mortality rate was 8.1 per 1,000 person-years for men and 6.6 per 1,000 person-years for women. Individuals with lower HDL-C levels were more likely to have low incomes, unhealthy lifestyle, higher triglycerides levels, other cardiac risk factors, and medical comorbidities. Individuals with lower HDL-C levels were independently associated with higher risk of CV, cancer, and other mortality compared with individuals in the reference ranges of HDL-C levels. In addition, individuals with higher HDL levels (>70 mg/dl in men, >90 mg/dl in women) had increased hazard of non-CV mortality. CONCLUSIONS Complex associations exist between HDL-C levels and sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidity factors, and mortality. HDL-C level is unlikely to represent a CV-specific risk factor given similarities in its associations with non-CV outcomes. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Where are we going?,HERZ,,,German,Review,,,,,,,,"Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major modifiable risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. Increasing LDL cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well as cardiovascular ischemic complications. Studies with statins and ultimately with ezetimibe have been able to impressively demonstrate that lowering LDL cholesterol contributes to a significant reduction of cardiovascular ischemic complications. Based on the results of randomized trials for lipid lowering, the practice guidelines developed by the professional societies have defined LDL cholesterol goals. High-risk patients, such as patients with clinically manifest cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes with organ damage, moderate or severe chronic kidney disease or a risk of SCORE aeyen10 %, should reach LDL cholesterol values < 70 mg/dl. Data from observational trials demonstrated that in daily practice only about 20 % of treated high-risk patients reached this recommended LDL cholesterol goal. The therapeutic options are not yet exhausted; patients are treated mainly with low or at most average statin dosages. There should be more potent and high-dose statins used as well as the combination therapy of statin and ezetimibe to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goals. Specific cardiac rehabilitation and prevention programs with regular benchmarking could support improved goal-achievement. The new therapeutic option of PCSK9 inhibitors, which significantly and safely lower LDL cholesterol on top of statins and ezetimibe, is currently investigated in large randomized outcome trials.","[Gitt, A.

Human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL protein, was fused to the trimerization domain of tetranectin (TN) and complexed with phospholipids to generate a HDL mimetic (lipidated TN-ApoA-I) with reduced renal clearance and enhanced efficacy. Cynomolgus monkeys received 24-h intravenous infusions of control, 100 mg/kg or 400 mg/kg lipidated TN-ApoA-I every 4 days for 3 weeks, followed by a 6-week recovery period. After multiple infusions of lipidated TN-ApoA-I, clinical condition deteriorated and was accompanied by changes indicative of a progressive inflammatory response; increased levels of cytokines, C-reactive protein and vascular/perivascular infiltrates in multiple tissues. Rapid formation of antidrug antibodies occurred in all animals receiving lipidated TN-ApoA-I. Enhanced drug clearance corresponding to a relative lack of high molecular weight immune complexes in blood, suggestive of preferred removal/clearance, was observed in some animals. Expected dose-dependent increases in serum lipids were accompanied by vacuolated monocytes/macrophages in multiple organs, which in the glomeruli were shown to be CD68-positive, contain lipid and co-localized with granular IgG deposits. Lipid accumulation may have been a direct result of a high drug load, possibly enhanced by immune complex formation, inflammation, and altered lipid metabolism. Noteworthy was the inter- individual inconsistency in the severity of clinical and histopathologic findings, drug clearance and inflammatory markers. In conclusion, multiple infusions of lipidated TN-ApoA-I resulted in high immunogenicity, lipid accumulation and were not well tolerated in nonhuman primates.","[Regenass-Lechner, Franziska; Mary, Jean-Luc; Richter, Wolfgang F.; Winter, Michael; Justies, Nicole; Langenkamp, Anja; Singer, Thomas; Atzpodien, Elke-Astrid] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Roche Innovat Ctr Basel, Roche Pharmaceut Res & Early Dev, Pharmaceut Sci, Grenzacherstr 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Staack, Roland F.; Jordan, Gregor] Roche Diagnost GmbH, Roche Pharmaceut Res & Early Dev, Bioanalyt Res & Dev, Roche Innovat Ctr Penzberg, D-82377 Penzberg, Germany; [Garrido, Rosario] Hoffmann La Roche Inc, Dept Nonclin Safety, 340 Kingsland St, Nutley, NJ 07110 USA; [Albassam, Mudher] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Roche Innovat Ctr New York, Roche Pharmaceut Res & Early Dev, Pharmaceut Sci, New York, NY 10016 USA",,"Regenass-Lechner, F (corresponding author), F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Roche Innovat Ctr Basel, Roche Pharmaceut Res & Early Dev, Pharmaceut Sci, Grenzacherstr 124, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.",franziska.regenass@roche.com,,,,,,,,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2016,150,2,,,,,378,389,,10.1093/toxsci/kfw004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfw004,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000374230300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: we reviewed the literature published in PUB-MED to discuss the role of residual dyslipidemia in particular high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], genetic factors, suboptimal implementation of lifestyle therapy, mood disorders associated to low compliance to application of evidence-based therapies or related to ASCVD. Results: we summarized the current knowledge on the topic, evidencing its contradictory aspects. Conclusion: HDL-C is an important biomarker for predicting cardiovascular risk, but the classical HDL hypothesis is no longer correct and it is now being replaced by the HDL function hypothesis, thought more studies are needed to validate it. The connection between cardiovascular risk and levels of TGs is not so definite. APOE genotype and Lp(a) levels are two genetics factors associated to CV risk.

We describe cholesterol treatment in an academic practice of family and internal medicine physicians to understand factors associated with achievement of guideline-based treatment goals in women compared with men. Primary care patients aged 40 to 75 years were included if they were prescribed a statin, had a Framingham risk score of >= 10%, had diabetes, or had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients were classified into Adult Treatment Panel III categories and assessed to whether they were in compliance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Odds ratios of goal adherence between women and men were calculated, and a multivariate model for goal achievement was created. In 2,747 patients, women were less likely to achieve cholesterol goals (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.95) despite having more prescriptions for statins (48% vs 39%, p < 0.001). More women than men failed to reach low-density lipoprotein goals because they were not prescribed a statin (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85) and women on high-intensity statins were less likely than men to achieve goals (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96). In all patients, diabetes was associated with nonattainment of cholesterol goals, but in high-risk women, the presence of diabetes improved goal achievement.

However, several large studies recently revealed that pharmacologic interventions that increase HDL-C concentration have not improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard therapy. In addition, specific genetic variants that raise HDL-C levels are not clearly associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These observations have challenged the 'HDL hypothesis' that HDL-C is causally related to ASCVD and that intervention to raise HDL-C will reduce ASCVD events. This article will present the current data on the HDL hypothesis and provide a revised paradigm of considering HDL in the atherosclerotic pathway. Recent findings Recent evidence has shed light on the complex nature of HDL-C metabolism and function. There are compelling data that the ability of HDL to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages, the first step in the 'reverse cholesterol transport' (RCT) pathway, is inversely associated with risk for ASCVD even after controlling for HDL-C. This has led to the 'HDL flux hypothesis' that therapeutic intervention that targets macrophage cholesterol efflux and RCT may reduce risk. Preclinical studies of such interventions show promise and early phase clinical studies, though small, are encouraging. Summary The role of HDL-C in modulating atherosclerotic disease is as yet uncertain. However, new findings and therapies targeting HDL-C show early promise and may provide an important intervention in attenuating the burden of ASCVD in the future.","[Siddiqi, Hasan K.; Kiss, Daniel; Rader, Daniel] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Hosp Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Siddiqi, HK (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Med, 3400 Spruce St,100 Centrex, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hasan.siddiqi@uphs.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,43,43,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015,30,5,,,,,536,542,,10.1097/HCO.0000000000000211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0000000000000211,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000369594600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent findings Numerous population studies have shown that plasma levels of HDL-C are inversely associated with CVD risk; in patient care HDL-C levels are therefore widely implemented in risk estimation models. A number of antiatherogenic properties have been ascribed to the HDL particle, but the hypothesis that HDL is causally related to CVD has been seriously challenged by recent data obtained from both human genetic studies and clinical trials. The final word on HDL-C as a therapeutic target is pending, as a number of clinical endpoint trials specifically focusing on the effect(s) of HDL-C increasing agents are underway. Moreover, recent data show that HDL efflux capacity could hold independent predictive value for CVD events, which clearly highlights the potential need to focus on HDL functionality, rather than on HDL-C levels. Summary The dogmatic concept that HDL-C levels predict future CVD events is undisputed, but the role of HDL-C as a causal factor in atherosclerosis has been challenged by a number of different types of studies. In recent years, a paradigm shift toward 'HDL functionality' is apparent. Whether or not optimizing these markers of HDL functionality actually does reduce CVD risk requires formal testing in prospective controlled studies.","[Hovingh, G.

Apolipoproteins are a key component of lipoproteins. Apolipoproteins are proteins that structure lipoproteins and regulate lipid metabolism through control of cellular lipid exchange. Constraints of cell culture and mouse models mean that there is a need for a complementary model that can replicate the complex in vivo milieu that regulates apolipoprotein and lipoprotein biology. Here, we further establish the utility of the genetically tractable and optically clear larval zebrafish as a model of apolipoprotein biology. Gene ancestry analyses were implemented to determine the closest human orthologs of the zebrafish apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apoB, apoE and apoA-IV genes and therefore ensure that they have been correctly named. Their expression patterns throughout development were also analyzed, by whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH). The ISH results emphasized the importance of apolipoproteins in transporting yolk and dietary lipids: mRNA expression of all apolipoproteins was observed in the yolk syncytial layer, and intestinal and liver expression was observed from 4-6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Furthermore, real-time PCR confirmed that transcription of three of the four zebrafish apoA-IV genes was increased 4 hours after the onset of a 1-hour high-fat feed. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that zebrafish ApoA-IV performs a conserved role to that in rat in the regulation of food intake by transiently overexpressing ApoA-IVb. 1 in transgenic larvae and quantifying ingestion of co-fed fluorescently labeled fatty acid during a high-fat meal as an indicator of food intake. Indeed, ApoA-IVb. 1 overexpression decreased food intake by approximately one-third. This study comprehensively describes the expression and function of eleven zebrafish apolipoproteins and serves as a springboard for future investigations to elucidate their roles in development and disease in the larval zebrafish model.","[Otis, Jessica P.; Zeituni, Erin M.; Thierer, James H.; Anderson, Jennifer L.; Brown, Alexandria C.; Boehm, Erica D.; Cerchione, Derek M.; Ceasrine, Alexis M.; Farber, Steven A.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Thierer, James H.; Boehm, Erica D.; Cerchione, Derek M.; Ceasrine, Alexis M.; Farber, Steven A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Avraham-Davidi, Inbal; Tempelhof, Hanoch; Yaniv, Karina] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel",,"Farber, SA (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",farber@ciwemb.edu,,,,,,,,70,71,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2015,8,3,,,,,295,309,,10.1242/dmm.018754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dmm.018754,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000352162300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptive immunity has been implicated in the process of disease initiation and progression interwined with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Although the body of knowledge regarding the correlation between atherosclerosis and immunity in humans is growing rapidly, a relevant proportion of it derives from studies carried out in animal models of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, while the mouse is a well-suited model, the results obtained therein are not fully transferrable to the human setting due to intrinsic genomic and environmental differences. In the present review, we will discuss mainly human findings, obtained either by examination of post-mortem and surgical atherosclerotic material or through the analysis of the immunological profile of peripheral blood cells. In particular, we will discuss the findings supporting a pro-atherogenic role of T cell subsets, such as effector memory T cells or the potential protective function of regulatory T cells. Recent studies suggest that traditional T cell-driven B2 cell responses appear to be atherogenic, while innate B1 cells appear to exert a protective action through the secretion of naturally occurring antibodies.

Development of pharmacological agents to activate Lxrs has been hindered by synthetic Lxr agonists' induction of hepatic lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia. Elucidating the function of Lxrs in regulating enterocyte lipid handling might identify novel aspects of lipid metabolism that are pharmacologically amenable. We took a genetic approach centered on the single Lxr gene nr1h3 in zebrafish to study the role of Lxr in enterocyte lipid metabolism. Loss of nr1h3 function causes anticipated gene regulatory changes and cholesterol intolerance, collectively reflecting high evolutionary conservation of zebrafish Lxra function. Intestinal nr1h3 activation delays transport of absorbed neutral lipids, with accumulation of neutral lipids in enterocyte cytoplasmic droplets. This delay in transport of ingested neutral lipids protects animals from hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. On a gene regulatory level, Lxra induces expression of acsl3a, which encodes acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3a, a lipid droplet-anchored protein that directs fatty acyl chains into lipids. Forced overexpression of acls3a in enterocytes delays, in part, the appearance of neutral lipids in the vasculature of zebrafish larvae.jlr Activation of Lxr in the intestine cell-autonomously regulates the rate of delivery of absorbed lipids by inducting a temporary lipid intestinal droplet storage depot","[Cruz-Garcia, Lourdes; Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Univ Utah Mol Med Program U2M2, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Cruz-Garcia, Lourdes; Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Dept Internal Med, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Metab & Diabet, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Schlegel, A (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Univ Utah Mol Med Program U2M2, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",amnons@u2m2.utah.edu,,,,,,,,34,36,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014,55,9,,,,,1944,1958,,10.1194/jlr.M052845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1194/jlr.M052845,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000343027500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, there is evidence in the literature that HDL protects the vasculature from inflammatory insult. We have previously shown that in HAECs, HDL attenuates the expression of several proatherogenic genes regulated by OxPAPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine. We now demonstrate that HDL reverses >50% of the OxPAPC transcriptional response. Genes reversed by HDL are enriched for inflammatory and vascular development pathways, while genes not affected by HDL are enriched for oxidative stress response pathways. The protective effect of HDL is partially mimicked by cholesterol repletion and treatment with apoA1 but does not require signaling through scavenger receptor class B type I. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that HDL protection requires direct interaction with OxPAPC. HDL-associated platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) hydrolyzes short-chain bioactive phospholipids in OxPAPC; however, inhibiting PAF-AH activity does not prevent HDL protection. Our results are consistent with HDL sequestering specific bioactive lipids in OxPAPC, thereby preventing their regulation of select target genes. Overall, this work implicates HDL as a major regulator of OxPAPC action in endothelial cells via multiple mechanisms.","[Emert, Benjamin; Hasin-Brumshtein, Yehudit; Vakili, Ladan; Berliner, Judith A.; Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Berliner, Judith A.; Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Immunol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lusis, Aldons J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Springstead, James R.] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",,"Lusis, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",Jlusis@mednet.ucla.edu,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,55,8,,,,,1678,1692,,10.1194/jlr.M047738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1194/jlr.M047738,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000343027400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite this body of scientific information demonstrating that low levels of HDL-C are an independent predictor of subsequent CAD events, multiple therapeutic attempts to raise HDL-C levels have failed to demonstrate a consistent reduction in prognostically important endpoints such as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Recently, several major randomized trials using different therapeutic interventions have raised appropriate concerns about our basic understanding of HDL-C and whether the HDL hypothesis of lowering cardiovascular events through therapeutic interventions directed at raising HDL-C is a scientifically viable one. While two recent randomized controlled trials (AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE) failed to show a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients treated to optimally low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at baseline with extended-release niacin on a background of simvastatin, these clinical trials studied specific populations of stable ischemic heart disease patients. The data from these two contemporary trials cannot be extrapolated to all patient populations, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction or those with significant residual mixed dyslipidemia not treated with optimal doses of intensive statin therapy, as these patients were excluded by trial design in both studies. Therefore, at the present time, there is insufficient evidence fromclinical trials to recommend HDL-targeted therapy for additional event reduction in CAD patients. However, we will review the relevant data from recent major trials (AIM-HIGH, HPS2-THRIVE, ILLUMINATE, and dal-OUTCOMES) and highlight the potential clinical implications of these trials in modern pharmacotherapy as it relates to HDL-C raising and potential cardiovascular event reduction.","[Tariq, Sayed M.] Albany Med Coll, Albany Med Ctr, Dept Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Sidhu, Mandeep S.; Boden, William E.] Albany Med Coll, Albany Stratton VA Med Ctr, Dept Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Sidhu, Mandeep S.; Boden, William E.] Albany Med Coll, Albany Med Ctr, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Toth, Peter P.] Univ Illinois, Sch Med, Dept Family & Community Med, Sterling, IL USA; [Toth, Peter P.] CGH Med Ctr, Sterling, IL USA",,"Boden, WE (corresponding author), Albany Med Coll, Albany Stratton VA Med Ctr, Dept Med, 113 Holland Ave, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",sidhum@mail.amc.edu; Peter.Toth@cghmc.com; william.boden@va.gov,,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2014,16,4,,,,,,,398,10.1007/s11883-014-0398-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-014-0398-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000335983900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Japanese inland prefecture, Tochigi, ranks higher mortality rate from CAD and lower seafood consumption, compared to other prefectures. The aim of this study was to investigate the EPA/AA ratio in residents of Tochigi prefecture. Methods We measured the EPA/AA ratio in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography, because of suspicion for having CAD, all of whom were residents of Tochigi prefecture or its bordering area. Patients A total of 428 patients were enrolled in 5 centers. Results The median value of the EPA/AA ratio in the study patients was 0.37, which seems to be lower than the value of the whole Japan. The EPA/AA ratio was similar in patients with and without CAD. Female patients had lower EPA/AA ratios than male patients. When subjects were divided into 10-year age groups, 30- to 39-year-old male and female patients displayed similar EPA/AA ratios. However, the ratios of 50- to 59-year old female patients (p=0.001) and 60- to 69-year old female patients (p=0.034) were significantly lower than those of age-matched male patients. Conclusion In female residents of Tochigi prefecture, and particularly in menopausal female patients suspected of CAD, the EPA/AA ratio might be lower than male patients.

Previously we discovered that mutation of the hepatocyte B-hydroxybutyrate transporter Slc16a6a in zebrafish causes hepatic steatosis during fasting, marked by increased hepatic triacylglycerol, but not cholesterol. This selective diversion of trapped ketogenic carbon atoms is surprising because acetate and acetoacetate can exit mitochondria and can be incorporated into both fatty acids and cholesterol in normal hepatocytes. To elucidate the mechanism of this selective diversion of carbon atoms to fatty acids, we fed wild-type and slc16a6a mutant animals high-protein ketogenic diets. We find that slc16a6a mutants have decreased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr), despite increased Hmgcr protein abundance and relative incorporation of mevalonate into cholesterol. These observations suggest the presence of an endogenous Hmgcr inhibitor. We took a candidate approach to identify such inhibitors. First, we found that mutant livers accumulate multiple polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and PUFA-CoAs, and we showed that human HMGCR is inhibited by PUFA-CoAs in vitro. Second, we injected mice with an ethyl ester of the PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid and observed an acute decrease in hepatic Hmgcr activity, without alteration in Hmgcr protein abundance. These results elucidate a mechanism for PUFA-mediated cholesterol lowering through direct inhibition of Hmgcr.","[Karanth, Santhosh; Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Mol Med U2M2 Program, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Karanth, Santhosh; Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol Metab & Diabet, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Vy My Tran; Kuberan, Balagurunathan] Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Kuberan, Balagurunathan] Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, Coll Pharm, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Schlegel, Amnon] Univ Utah, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Schlegel, A (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Mol Med U2M2 Program, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",amnons@u2m2.utah.edu,,,,,,,,14,15,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2013,6,6,,,,,1365,1377,,10.1242/dmm.013425,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dmm.013425,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000329275000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results: Of the 307 patients, 180 had CAD. We found that age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and CHOLINDEX were independent predictors of CAD.

During the follow-up major cardiovascular events (MCE; beginning of dialysis, cerebrovascular insult or myocardial infarction) were recorded. The follow-up period ended December 2010. Findings: Over all total cholesterol (4.3 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (1.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001), HDL (1.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6 mmol/l, p = 0.003) and TC/HDL ratio (3.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2, p = 0.002) increased significantly after 1 year.

Objective: The aim of this prospective international multicenter study of statin-naive individuals was to evaluate the association of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol (TC) to coronary plaque composition by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Methods: We studied 4575 individuals without known coronary artery disease not taking statin medications who underwent coronary CTA. Comparisons were made between those with high versus low LDL, HDL, TC, and non-HDL. We assessed the relationship of lipoproteins and plaques of specific composition (noncalcified [NCP], partially calcified [PCP], or calcified [CP] plaque). Results: Mean age was 57 +/- 11 years (55% men). In univariable analyses, high LDL, low HDL, high TC, and high non-HDL were each associated with increased prevalence of NCPs, PCPs, and CPs (P < 0.05 for all). In multivariable analyses, high non-HDL was associated with the presence of NCP (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.78: P < 0.001).

Y.; Arnold, Steven E.",,,Vascular disease and dementias: Paradigm shifts to drive research in new directions,ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Vascular disease was once considered the principal cause of aging-related dementia. More recently, however, research emphasis has shifted to studies of progressive neurodegenerative disease processes, such as those giving rise to neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and Lewy bodies. Although these studies have led to critical insights and potential therapeutic strategies, interest in the role of systemic and cerebrovascular disease mechanisms waned and has received relatively less attention and research support. Recent studies suggest that vascular disease mechanisms play an important role in the risk for aging-related cognitive decline and disorders. Vascular disease frequently coexists with cognitive decline in aging individuals, shares many risk factors with dementias considered to be of the Alzheimer type, and is observed more frequently than expected in postmortem material from individuals manifesting specific disease stigmata, such as abundant plaques and tangles. Considerable difficulties have emerged in attempting to classify dementias as being related to vascular versus neurodegenerative causes, and several systems of criteria have been used. Despite multiple attempts, a lack of consensus remains regarding the optimal means of incorporating vascular disease into clinical diagnostic, neurocognitive, or neuropathologic classification schemes for dementias. We propose here an integrative, rather than a strictly taxonomic, approach to the study and elucidation of how vascular disease mechanisms contribute to the development of dementias. We argue that, instead of discriminating between, for example, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other diseases, there is a greater need to focus clinical and research efforts on elucidating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to dementia phenotypes and neuropathologic outcomes. We outline a multitiered strategy, beginning with clinical and public health interventions that can be implemented immediately, enhancements to ongoing longitudinal studies to increase their informative value, and new initiatives to capitalize on recent advances in systems biology and network medicine. This strategy will require funding from multiple public and private sources to support collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts to take full advantage of these opportunities and realize their societal benefits.

J,"Despres, JP",,,,"Despres, Jean-Pierre",,,Abdominal Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease: Is Inflammation the Missing Link?,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"It is well established that cardiovascular disease has an inflammatory component. The present narrative review explores the role of adipose tissue distribution, morphology, and function as potential mediators of the link between inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Evidence that abdominal obesity is a key driving force behind a constellation of athero-thrombotic inflammatory abnormalities linked to insulin resistance and often referred to as the metabolic syndrome is also reviewed. It is also proposed that the amount of visceral adipose tissue and the liver fat content are important factors responsible for the link between abdominal obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome. It is suggested that the inflammatory profile associated with excess visceral adipose tissue/liver fat may be a consequence of the relative inability of subcutaneous adipose tissue to expand through hyperplasia and to act as a protective metabolic sink storing the chronic energy surplus resulting from a positive energy balance (overnutrition or lack of physical activity or both). In this model, the inflammatory profile often observed among sedentary over-weight/obese individuals with an excess of visceral adipose tissue/ liver fat may be a consequence of a more primary defect in subcutaneous adipose tissue. On that basis, it is proposed that therapeutic strategies relieving the stress for storage of a chronic energy surplus in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (reduced caloric intake, increase in energy expenditure, pharmacotherapy) should induce a substantial loss of visceral adipose tissue and of ectopic fat depots such as the liver, thereby substantially reducing inflammation.","[Despres, Jean-Pierre] Inst Univ Cardiol & Pneumol Quebec, Ctr Rech, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4G5, Canada; [Despres, Jean-Pierre] Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Kinesiol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",,"Despres, JP (corresponding author), Inst Univ Cardiol & Pneumol Quebec, Ctr Rech, 4th Floor,2725 Chemin, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4G5, Canada.",jean-pierre.despres@criucpq.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,,82,85,,,,,,,,,,,NOV-DEC,2012,28,6,,,,,642,652,,10.1016/j.cjca.2012.06.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2012.06.004,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000312260400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of the multiple cardiometabolic risk factor clustering syndrome has been proposed as a highly atherogenic state, independent of hypercholesterolemia and smoking. Body fat distribution, especially visceral fat accumulation, is a major correlate of a cluster of diabetogenic, atherogenic, prothrombotic, and proinflammatory metabolic abnormalities referred to as the metabolic syndrome, with dysfunctional adipocytes and dysregulated production of adipocytokines (hypoadiponectinemia). Medical research has focused on visceral adiposity as an important component of the syndrome in Japanese subjects with a mild degree of adiposity compared with Western subjects. For the prevention of ACVD at least in Japan, it might be practical to stratify subjects with multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease based on visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat reduction through health promotion programs using risk factor-oriented approaches may be effective in reducing ACVD events, as well as producing improvement in risks and hypoadiponectinemia. This review article discusses visceral adiposity as a key player in the syndrome. Visceral fat reduction with life-style modification is a potentially useful strategy in the prevention of ACVD in patients with the metabolic syndrome.","[Kishida, Ken; Funahashi, Tohru; Shimomura, Iichiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Metab Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Matsuzawa, Yuji] Sumitomo Hosp, Osaka, Japan",,"Kishida, K (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Metab Med, 2-2 B-5 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kkishida@imed2.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,59,60,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,44,3,,,,,233,241,,10.3109/07853890.2011.564202,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07853890.2011.564202,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000302319700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our aim was to study the informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality in a large, homogeneous population. Blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline (1995-1997) in 28,158 men and 32,573 women. Information on deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was obtained from the Causes of Death Registry in Norway from baseline until the end of 2007. Informativeness was analysed using the difference in twice the log-likelihood of a Cox model with and without each index. During 11 years of follow-up, 597 men and 418 women had died from IHD. Systolic blood pressure in men and pulse pressure in women were the most informative predictors of blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI was the most informative expression of obesity in both men and women. Among serum lipids, the most informative predictor was the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. Using more informative expressions of conventional risk factors for ischemic heart disease may improve both the validity and precision of estimates of risk, and may be useful both clinically and for preventive purposes.","[Morkedal, Bjorn; Romundstad, Pal R.; Vatten, Lars J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,"Morkedal, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bjornm@stud.ntnu.no; pal.romundstad@ntnu.no; lars.vatten@ntnu.no,,,,,,,,33,35,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2011,26,6,,,,,457,461,,10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000293164500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although lowering LDL-cholesterol levels is the primary target of therapy in most clinical guidelines, accumulating evidence indicates that other lipoprotein-lipid measurements could provide a predictive value over and above that of LDL-cholesterol levels. For example, individuals treated with statins who achieve low LDL-cholesterol levels, but have high concentrations of either non-HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein (apo) B, remain at increased cardiovascular risk. Similarly, individuals with low levels of either HDL cholesterol or apo A-I are also likely to experience cardiovascular events, despite having normal LDL-cholesterol levels. The residual cardiovascular risk, beyond that characterized by LDL-cholesterol levels alone, is exacerbated by physical inactivity and abdominal obesity, which are both increasingly prevalent risk factors for CVD. In this Review, we discuss the measurement of various lipoprotein-lipid parameters for the prediction of CVD risk, and their importance in identifying those patients who are likely to benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.

J,"Quist-Paulsen, P",,,,"Quist-Paulsen, Petter",,,Statins and inflammation: an update,CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Purpose of review Randomized trials have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins could extend to mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. Investigations have shown that statins are associated with reduced plasma markers of inflammation, reduced T-cell and monocyte activation, and reduced blood clotting. These effects could be explained by the inhibition of L-mevalonic acid synthesis, thus affecting cell-signalling pathways. However, it has been difficult to evaluate whether the nonlipid effects of statins translate into clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent findings Inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), has been established as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, even in persons with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Statins have anti-inflammatory effects, and lower CRP. Reducing both LDL-cholesterol and CRP is important in order to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Statins significantly reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. It is probable that this effect goes beyond lipid lowering. The clinical benefit of statin therapy in infectious diseases remains to be determined by randomized controlled trials. Summary Statins have anti-inflammatory properties that are clinically important in lowering cardiovascular risk. It is probable, but not definitely proven, that some of the benefits of statins are due to their nonlipid effects.","[Quist-Paulsen, Petter] Univ Trondheim Hosp, St Olavs Hosp, Dept Hematol, N-7006 Trondheim, Norway; [Quist-Paulsen, Petter] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Canc Res & Mol Med, Fac Med, Trondheim, Norway",,"Quist-Paulsen, P (corresponding author), Univ Trondheim Hosp, St Olavs Hosp, Dept Hematol, N-7006 Trondheim, Norway.",petter.quist-paulsen@stolav.no,,,,,,,,71,75,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2010,25,4,,,,,399,405,,10.1097/HCO.0b013e3283398e53,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HCO.0b013e3283398e53,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000278569800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The wealth of novel scientific data that it has generated over 5 decades has made a significant contribution to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in the United States and indirectly influenced global CVD prevention strategies. The Framingham Study has provided insights into the prevalence, incidence, prognosis, predisposing factors, and determinants of CVD. The now well-established risk factor concept, fundamental to prevention of CVD, originated from the Framingham study. It generated seminal findings such as the effects of tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, raised blood cholesterol, raised blood pressure, and diabetes on CVD. When these findings were first published, these were novel cardiovascular risk factors, now they are the major focus for global and national prevention efforts for reducing the burden of CVD and other major noncommunicable diseases. The Framingham Heart Study has also been in the forefront of the development of cardiovascular risk prediction equations for assessment of absolute risk. Further developments in this area including the development of World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension risk prediction charts have resulted in a paradigm shift in CVD prevention strategies, from a single risk factor focus to a more cost-effective total cardiovascular risk approach, an approach recommended by the World Health Organization for CVD prevention worldwide.

Because young patients presenting with a first myocardial infarction (MI) tend to have less significant risk profiles compared with older patients, we hypothesized that FRS may underestimate cardiac risk in these patients. Materials and Methods: We studied 1267 patients between January 2002 and November 2007 presenting with a first MI. Patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus and vascular disease were excluded. FRS was calculated for each patient. Patients were divided based on their age: group A (<40 years), group B (40 to 64 years) and group C (>= 65 years). Results: The mean age was 54.7 +/- 11 years, 88.4% of the patients were males. Younger patients were more likely to be assigned with lower scores. Based on FRS, 63.0%, 29.3% and 14.2% of group A, B and C patients were classified as low risk (10-year risk for cardiac events<10%) respectively, P <0.001. The sensitivity of FRS in identifying at least intermediate risk subjects (10-year risk for cardiac events >10%) was 37.0% in group A vs 85.8% in group C (P <0.001). The incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was higher in younger patients (12.0% vs 13.2% vs 7.1% in groups A, B and C respectively, P = 0.027). Conclusions: FRS inadequately predicts cardiac risk in young patients presenting with a first MI.

The Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Education (SHAPE) Task Force from the Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication (SHAPE) has proposed a new strategy that recommends screening for subclinical atherosclerosis and implementing aggressive treatment of vulnerable patients. The Task Force has also envisioned future developments that may shift mass screening strategies to mass prophylactic therapy. The Polypill concept, introduced by Wald and Law, suggests that a combination of statin, low-dose anti-hypertensive, aspirin and folic acid in a single pill taken prophylactically by a high risk population can cut CVD event rates by as much as 80%. In this communication, we review the challenges and promises of such a strategy. Polypill is but one of an almost infinite number of possible multiconstituent pills (MCCP). The MCCP concept, although attractive, lacks evidence from randomized controlled trials. The following need to be addressed: credibility of the concept, design and synthesis of such complex pills, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, bioequivalence, class vs. unique properties, interactions, clinical efficacy and safety, regulatory approval, post-marketing surveillance, prescription vs. over-the- counter use, responsibility for initiating and monitoring therapy, patient education, counterfeiting and importation, reimbursement, advertisement, patent protection, and commercial viability. If these issues are favorably addressed, MCCP is poised to dramatically alter the face of CVD prevention, particularly in developing societies. Universal adoption of highly effective, safe, and inexpensive MCCP has the potential to become a major public healthcare initiative in the movement for the worldwide eradication of heart attacks. Nonetheless, in the absence of commercial interests, realizing the promise of MCCP will demand serious attention from national public health policymakers.","[Jamieson, Michael J.] Pfizer Inc, RMRS Cardiovasc, Houston, TX USA; [Hecht, Harvey S.] Lenox Hill Hosp, Dept Intervent Cardiol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Naghavi, Morteza] SHAPE, Houston, TX 77024 USA",,"Jamieson, MJ (corresponding author), Pfizer Inc, RMRS Cardiovasc, Houston, TX USA.",mn@vp.org,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,635,647,,10.1007/978-1-60327-179-0_49,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60327-179-0_49,10.1007/978-1-60327-179-0,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000276203100049,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, statins have been increasingly used in preventive strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk. More recent reports have demonstrated an incremental benefit with use of higher doses of statins and when used early in the setting of acute ischemic syndromes. Although lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is likely to underscore the majority of the clinical benefit, emerging evidence suggests that additional properties may also be important. In particular, a number of reports have demonstrated that modest elevations in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are likely to contribute to the benefit of statins.

Epidemiologic studies examining the association between corneal arcus and coronary artery disease (CAD) have yielded mixed results. This study was conducted to determine if corneal arcus is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CAD. A prospective analysis was performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression models in the Framingham Heart Study Original Cohort and Offspring Cohort database. This cohort included 23,376 patient-examinations, during 3,890 (17%) of which corneal arcus was identified. Corneal arcus was a predictor of CVD, and CAD at 4 years (hazard ratios [HRs] 2.28 and 1.99, respectively) and 8 years (HRs 2.52 and 2.35, respectively) of follow-up (p <0.0001 for all). Corneal arcus was no longer predictive of either CVD or CAD, however, after adjustment for age and gender at 4 years (HRs 1.07 and 1.01, respectively) and 8 years (HRs 1.18 and 1.17, respectively) of follow-up (p >0.05 for all). In conclusion, corneal arcus predicted CVD and CAD in the community-based Framingham Heart Study cohort because of the strong association of corneal arcus with increasing age.

After their first screening examination, which decides their fitness for flight, pilots are required to appear for screening examinations yearly, which makes it possible to monitor the changes in the risk factors of ischemic heart disease (IHD) from their candidate days until their retirement or final grounding. Subjects and Methods: During regular fitness screenings, we determined the individual and common occurrence and changes of recorded or measured IHD risk factors on the basis of 10- (baseline), 5-, and 0-year (current) data in the cases of 250 active male military pilots, broken down into 5-year age groups. In addition, by the help of complex risk calculation methods, we calculated the 5- and 10-year risk of coronary artery disease and CVDs, respectively. Results: In the first year of the examinations, the following risk factors appeared: positive family history (25.0%), obesity (40.8%), smoking (31.7%), physical inactivity (23.9%), high blood pressure (14.7%), hypercholesterolemia (53.9%), pathological electrocardiogram deviations (1.3%). By aging, the occurrence of each risk factor remained unchanged or increased and their cumulative occurrence became more frequent, except for those above 45 to 50 yrs, who seldom had four or more risk factors at the same time. The cardiovascular risk calculated by the Futrex program was elevated in 40% of the study population (levels 3 and 4). By aging, the indices received by complex risk calculation methods deteriorated in the age group 25 to 45 years, while they improved in the age group of >45 years. The 5-year risk of CVDs was below 2.5% in half of the study population and it did not exceed 15 to 20% even in the age group with the highest risk. Discussion: Based on reference data, pilots usually represent a healthier population in those countries where coronary artery diseases are leading health problems. In Hungary, many young pilots leave the army due to its currently ongoing transformation, while the elder are less motivated to change careers. It is probably the role of the stricter physical fitness test and screening examinations, and the effect of military propaganda targeting health conservation, that is in the background of the elder pilots' value improvements. It is also an influencing factor that by administering antilipid and antihypertensive medication based on NATO recommendations in the cases of those with increased risk, the probability of the development of IHD decreases and the affected pilots can be kept longer in service.","Hungarian Def Forces, Aeromed Hosp, H-6000 Kecskemet, Hungary; Univ Szeged, Fac Med, Dept Aerosp Med, H-6000 Kecskemet, Hungary",,"Grosz, A (corresponding author), Hungarian Def Forces, Aeromed Hosp, 17 Balaton U, H-6000 Kecskemet, Hungary.",,,,,,,,,11,12,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2007,172,2,,,,,214,219,,10.7205/MILMED.172.2.214,http://dx.doi.org/10.7205/MILMED.172.2.214,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000244232600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the publication of the NCEP ATP III guidelines, several large-scale clinical trials of cholesterol lowering have been conducted, the findings of which have the potential to impact on clinical practice standards. In this article we focus on current guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy, review the results and implications of important completed clinical trials, and consider the utility of additional targets for preventive therapy, such as C-reactive protein and HDL. We also consider the prospects for treatments in development and future goals.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Cardiovasc Div,TIMI Study Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Wiviott, SD (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Cardiovasc Div,TIMI Study Grp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",swiviott@partners.org,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2006,3,8,,,,,424,436,,10.1038/ncpcardio0613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncpcardio0613,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000239340400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A straightforward and accurate means of calculating overall cardiovascular risk has been derived from the PROspective CArdiovascular Munster (PROCAM) Study, a large observational cohort study. The PROCAM risk calculator has several advantages over other risk calculators. For example, the algorithm derived from the Framingham study consistently and markedly overestimates the risk of myocardial infarction in the PROCAM population, or in a German cohort within the Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) Study, administered by the World Health Organization. In addition, the PROCAM risk calculator incorporates a broader range of commonly measured diagnostic parameters than the Framingham risk calculator. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model that supports the PROCAM risk calculator has also provided valuable information on the principal driving forces behind atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with age, the level of LDL-cholesterol, smoking, the level of HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, family history of myocardial infarction, diagnosis of diabetes, and triglycerides all making significant contributions. As in other studies, low HDL-cholesterol emerged as a significant and independent risk factor for coronary disease, providing support for strategies aimed at correcting low HDL-cholesterol in addition to those aimed at reducing elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol.","Univ Munster, Inst Arteriosclerosis Res, Domagkstr 3, D-48149 Munster, Germany",,"Assmann, G (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Arteriosclerosis Res, Domagkstr 3, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",assmann@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2005,7,F,,,,,F9,F14,,10.1093/eurheartj/sui037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/sui037,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000230780800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Statins were originally developed as lipid-lowering drugs to combat high-cholesterol and attenuate coronary artery disease. Wide-ranging clinical and basic science investigations have now suggested that statins may provide beneficial effects outside of reductions in low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. These cholesterol-independent actions have been found to downregulate vascular inflammation and promote cardioprotection against ischemic disorders and heart failure. Mechanisms of this protection include increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and a subsequent rise in nitric oxide bioavailability.

A literature search revealed that the status of lipid-lowering therapy based on the current JAS recommendations in Japan has not been assessed. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of current lipid-lowering regimens, and to provide the best possible therapeutic strategies for patients with hyperlipidemia by identifying risk factors for the development of CHD, based on the current JAS recommendations. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective study was conducted using data from patients under the care of physicians at 12,500 randomly selected institutions across Japan. Physicians received a survey concerning lipid-lowering therapy, on which each physician provided data from 10 consecutive adult patients with hyperlipidemia. who had been prescribed lipid-lowering therapy for at least 3 months before the survey was administered, and who were undergoing routine follow-up on an outpatient basis. Physicians provided patients' demographic and clinical data, including JAS-defined CHD risk classification, coronary risk factors and pre- and posttreatment (after >= 3 months) serum lipid levels, and the types and dosages of drugs in patients' current and prior treatment regimens. These data were used to assess the efficacy of lipid-lowering regimens and rates of patients achieving the SLMGs recommended by the JAS. Results: A total of 2540 physicians participated in the survey, and data from 24,893 Japanese patients (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [10.5] years) with hyperlipidemia were included in the study. Patients with familial hyperlipidemia (845/24,893 [3.4%]) were excluded from most of the analyses, leaving 24,048 patients with primary hyperlipidemia. The most prevalent coronary risk factors included age (21,902 [91.1%]), hypertension (14,275 [59.4%]), diabetes mellitus type 2 and/or impaired glucose tolerance (6346 [26.4%]), and smoking (3841 [16.0%]). A total of 20,948 patients (87.1%) had a CHD risk classification of B (ie, >= 1 coronary risk factor but no history of CHD). At the time of the survey, the lipid-lowering regimens of 22,080 patients (91.8%) included a statin. The rates of achievement of SLMGs were as follows: total cholesterol (TC), 12,659/23,840 patients (53.1%); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 14,025/22,121 (63.4%); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 19,702/21,279 (92.6%); and triglycerides (TG), 14,892/23,569 (63.2%). TC and LDL-C goals were achieved by most patients (>= 61.1%) in risk categories A, B1, and B2 (ie, 0-2 coronary risk factors; low to moderate risk) but by a low percentage of patients (<= 45.4%) in risk categories B3, B4, and C (ie, >= 3 coronary risk factors or history of CHD; high risk). In the high-risk group (n = 10,515), the TC goal was achieved by 4059 patients (38.6%). The TC and LDL-C goals were achieved by significantly higher percentages of patients prescribed atorvastatin (5133/7928 [64.7%] and 5487/7426 [73.9%], respectively) compared with the rates of patients prescribed any other statin at the recommended starting doses (all, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study of Japanese patients undergoing lipid-lowering therapy for the prevention of CHD, prescribed based on the recommendations in the JAS guideline, suggest insufficient reduction of TC, LDL-C, and TG in patients at high risk for CHD and the need for more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy in such patients.

METHODS: Chinese, Polish, Russian, and US population-based samples were studied. The relationship between cholesterol levels and mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazard regression with restricted piecewise cubic splines. RESULTS: The cholesterol and total mortality relationship was statistically significantly J-shaped for all men combined. In country-specific relationships, cholesterol was significantly, linearly, and positively related to total mortality in Russian and US men. For women, the relationship was non-linear, but not statistically significant, and became statistically significant upon adjustment for other risk factors. For Polish women, a statistically significant inverse relationship existed. CHD mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality increased linearly with cholesterol in Polish, Russian, and US men and the aggregate of men, but there was no relationship for women. Cancer mortality was not related to cholesterol except for the Polish cohort and Russian women, where there was an inverse relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Serum cholesterol was a strong, consistent predictor of CHD and CVD mortality in Polish, Russian, and US men despite their social diversity. In contrast to CHD mortality, the relation of cholesterol to total mortality and non-CVD mortality varied by country and gender. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Recalibration of Framingham functions could permit various regions of the world to adapt Framingham tools to local populations. Objective To evaluate the performance of the Framingham CHD risk functions, directly and after recalibration, in a large Chinese population, compared with the performance of the functions derived from the Chinese Multi-provincial Cohort Study (CMCS). Design, Setting, and Participants The CMCS cohort included 30121 Chinese adults aged 35 to 64 years at baseline. Participants were recruited from 11 provinces and were followed up for new CHD events from 1992 to 2002. Participants in the Framingham Heart Study were 5251 white US residents of Framingham, Mass, who were 30 to 74 years old at baseline in 1971 to 1974 and followed up for 12 years. Main Outcome Measures Hard CHD (coronary death and myocardial infarction) was used as the end point in comparisons of risk factors (age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) as evaluated by the CMCS functions, original Framingham functions, and recalibrated Framingham functions. Results The CMCS cohort had 191 hard CHD events and 625 total deaths vs 273 CHD events and 293 deaths, respectively, for Framingham. For most risk factor categories, the relative risks for CHID were similar for Chinese and Framingham participants, with a few exceptions (ie, age, total cholesterol of 200-239 mg/dL [5.18-6.19 mmol/L], and HDL-C less than 35 mg/dL [0.91 mmol/L] in men; smoking in women). The discrimination using the Framingham functions in the CMCS cohort was similar to the CMCS functions: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.705 for men and 0.742 for women using the Framingham functions vs 0.736 for men and 0.759 for women using the CMCS functions. However, the original Framingham functions systematically overestimated the absolute CHD risk in the CMCS cohort. For example, in the 10th risk decile in men, the predicted rate of CHD death was 20% Vs an actual rate of 3%. Recalibration of the Framingham functions using the mean values of risk factors and mean CHD incidence rates of the CMCS cohort substantially improved the performance of the Framingham functions in the CMCS cohort. Conclusions The original Framingham functions overestimated the risk of CHD for CMCS participants. Recalibration of the Framingham functions improved the estimates and demonstrated that the Framingham model is useful in the Chinese population. For regions that have no established cohort, recalibration using CHD rates and risk factors may be an effective method to develop CHD risk prediction algorithms suited for local practice.","Beijing Inst Heart Lung & Blood Vessel Dis, Dept Epidemiol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Amer Heart Assoc, Dallas, TX USA; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Liu, J (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Heart Lung & Blood Vessel Dis, Dept Epidemiol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",jingliu0516@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,,464,518,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 2,2004,291,21,,,,,2591,2599,,10.1001/jama.291.21.2591,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.291.21.2591,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000221738800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results: Serum paraoxonase activity was lower in CHD patients with type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia. During the three-month study it was observed that following treatment with micronised fenofibrate, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased, while HDL-C increased significantly (p < 0.001).

With the demonstration in large-scale randomized clinical trials that aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with statins reduced the risk of IHD, the central role of LDL cholesterol in the pathogenesis of IHD was proven. However, many IHD cases occur in people with normal LDL cholesterol levels, and it is well known that the ability to predict who will develop IHD based on LDL cholesterol levels alone is limited. Plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are two other lipid variables that over the years have attracted attention in cardiovascular epidemiology. Recently, much more attention has been paid to the relationship between triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and risk of IHD because the combined lipid profile of a high fasting triglyceride level and a low HDL cholesterol level is the characteristic dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome X. The objective of the present review article is to use data from the Copenhagen Male Study to demonstrate that, in men, fasting hypertriglyceridemia is a strong risk factor of IHD independent of other major risk factors of IHD, and that the combined lipid profile of a high fasting triglyceride level and a low HDL cholesterol level, the characteristic dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome X, is a very strong and important risk factor of IHD, at least as strong and important as a high LDL cholesterol level.","[Jeppesen, Jorgen] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Epidemiol Res Unit, Copenhagen Male Study, Bispebjerg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Jorgen] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Ctr Prevent Med, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Jeppesen, J (corresponding author), Copenhagen Univ Hosp Bispebjerg, Epidemiol Res Unit, Copenhagen Male Study, Bispebjerg Bakke 23, DK-2400 Copenhagen NV, Denmark.",jjep@dadlnet.dk,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2003,1,1,,,,,33,53,,10.1089/154041903321648243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/154041903321648243,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000208973500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present trial evaluated the effect of the angiotensin Il receptor antagonist, valsartan, on the lipid profile and glucose metabolism in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 3-week dietary run-in period under placebo; thereafter, patients received either valsartan. 80 mg orally once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. A total of 123 patients were randomized, of whom 112 patients completed the study. Valsartan significantly lowered systolic blood pressure by 14.1 +/- 12.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 9.0 +/- 6.6 mmHg. In the placebo group, the corresponding values were 7.8 +/- 14.9 mmHg and 6.2 +/- 7.3 mmHg, respectively. Additionally, in the valsartan group, there was a significant decrease in levels of both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (valsartan, -6.3 +/- 24.9 mg/dl; placebo, +4.2 +/- 27.0 mg/dl) and total cholesterol (valsartan, -7.1 +/- 28.1 mg/dI; placebo, +6.0 +/- 29.4 mg/dl) in comparison with placebo. No significant changes were observed in the levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B after valsartan treatment. No effect of valsartan was found with respect to fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels. Valsartan therapy was safe and well tolerated in our patient population. In conclusion, in addition to the marked decrease in blood pressure, valsartan significantly reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels and is neutral on glucose metabolism.","Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Endocrinol & Metab Res, Ctr Clin Studies, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Novartis Pharma GmbH, Dept Med, Nurnberg, Germany",,"Hanefeld, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Endocrinol & Metab Res, Ctr Clin Studies, Fiedlerstr 34, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",,,,,,,,,26,27,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-AUG,2001,29,4,,,,,270,279,,10.1177/147323000102900402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/147323000102900402,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000171497500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, it discusses how intestinal lipid transporters may play a role in the uptake of lipids by the enterocytes, and how chylomicrons are formed in the enterocytes and packaged for export into the lymphatic system through exocytosis. The classification and properties of lipids is first described followed by a discussion of structured lipids and their role in human nutrition. Digestion of triacylglycerols takes place in the stomach aided by the enzyme gastric lipase. The origin and properties of lingual and gastric lipase are reviewed. Most digestion of triacylglycerols by pancreatic lipase occurs in the intestinal lumen. Similarly, digestion of cholesteryl ester and phospholipids also takes place in the intestinal lumen. This review describes in considerable detail the uptake of lipid digestion products by the enterocytes, particularly the role of recently identified lipid transporters. The intracellular trafficking and the resynthesis of complex lipids from the lipid digestion products are talked about, particularly within the context of the recently generated knockout mouse that lacks the key lipid reesterification enzymes. Finally, the mechanisms of the formation and secretion of chylomicrons is described and clinical disorders discussed.","Univ Cincinnati, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA",,"Tso, P (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, 231 Albert Sabin Way,ML 0529, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.",tsopp@email.uc.edu,,,,,,,,169,174,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2001,6,,,,,,D299,D319,,10.2741/Phan,http://dx.doi.org/10.2741/Phan,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000167361500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental feeding studies show that saturated fat and cholesterol increase serum cholesterol levels; thus, dietary recommendations for lowering the risk of heart disease proscribe the intake of both substances. Recommendations have also included limits on the intake of eggs because of their high cholesterol content. In free-living populations, diet reflects a pattern of associated choices. Increases in one food may lead to changes in the consumption of other foods that may modulate disease risk. Epidemiologic data are helpful in assessing the importance of foods and nutrients in the context in which they are actually consumed. We review epidemiologic data relating dietary cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk. Cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events. The true magnitude of the association is difficult to estimate because most studies fail to account for potential confounding by other features of the diet. When a full-range of confounding factors was considered, the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/1,000kcal/day difference in cholesterol intake). Several studies have examined egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcomes. All but one failed to consider the role of other potentially confounding dietary factors. When dietary confounders were considered, no association was seen between egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.","Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Prevent Med, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Kritchevsky, SB (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Prevent Med, 66 N Pauline,Suite 633, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",,,,,,,,,59,65,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2000,19,5,,S,,,549S,555S,,10.1080/07315724.2000.10718979,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2000.10718979,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000089657800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Llerena, IR; Huerta, EM",,,,"Llerena, IR; Huerta, EM",,,Wine and the heart,REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CARDIOLOGIA,,,Spanish,Review,,,,,,,,"Many epidemiological studies have shown that moderate alcohol intake, from 10 to 30 g of ethanol a day, decreases cardiovascular mortality from atheroesclerotic ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke as compared to non-drinkers. This beneficial effect outweighs the risks of alcohol consumption in subgroups of people with a higher risk of atheroesclerosis: the elderly, people with coronary risk factors and patients with previous coronary events. It has not been demonstrated that alcohol intake, even in moderate amounts, is beneficial for the general population, in particular, men under the age of 40 and women under 50, because it raises mortality due to other causes, especially injury, cirrhosis of the liver and some types of cancer, thereby outweighing the benefits for coronary artery disease. Thus, alcohol consumption should not be recommended as a prophylaxis for the general population. Guidelines on alcohol drinking habits -whether to continue, to start, to modify or to stop- must be given on an individual basis, taking into account the relative risks and benefits for each patient. The benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on the cardiovascular system seem to be exerted fundamentally through its effects on plasma lipoproteins, principally by raising high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and to a lesser degree, by decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It appears to exert additional beneficial effects on the heart by decreasing platelet agregability and by bringing about changes in the clotting-fibrinolysis system. Although there has been some debate about the relative superiority of different types of alcoholic beverages (mine, beer or hard Liquor), and to a greater extent, about different types of mine, there is no current evidence of any kind of beneficial effect from other components of the beverage besides ethanol. Thus, it does not seem appropriate to recommend any particular type of alcoholic drink, except for sociocultural reasons. The added benefits hom some components of different types of mine with a high antioxidant activity on plasma Lipoproteins remain only an interesting hypothesis. Meanwhile, encouraging a healthy diet, flavonoid rich and with a predominance of natural ingredients (fruit, legumes, cereals and seeds), in the general population should stop the current tendency of Southern European countries from abandoning the Mediterranean diet. Because of the multifactorial nature of coronary heart disease, it is necessary to remember that atheroesclerotic risk reduction is achieved by behavior modification of multiple risk factors present in individual patients and in the general population. Therefore, guidelines regarding alcohol intake should always be Linked to pertinent recommendations about other atheroesclerotic risk factors.","Hosp Ramon & Cajal, Serv Cardiol, E-28034 Madrid, Spain; Hosp 12 Octubre, Serv Cardiol, E-28041 Madrid, Spain",,"Huerta, EM (corresponding author), Hosp Ramon & Cajal, Serv Cardiol, Ctra Colmenar Km 9-100, E-28034 Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,1998,51,6,,,,,435,449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:000074327900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Funoran and CPIB significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), triglyceride (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL), and atherogenic index (AI) levels in these rats. The increase of sodium, water excretion and sodium-potassium ratio in urine in the funoran group was more significant in the experimental rats than in the control group. Moreover, the ratio of Na and K in serum decreased with the funoran diet. The CPIB diet enhanced cholesterol level in the liver while the funoran diet suppressed the level, but in feces the former diet did not change the cholesterol level while the latter diet increased it. These results suggest that the enhanced ability to excrete sodium in urine by the funoran diet is an important factor for reducing blood pressure and that the antihyperlipidemic effect of funoran was not caused by the mobilization of peripheral cholesterol on the liver, but by the enhanced excretion of cholesterol into feces.","NIHON UNIV, COLL AGR & VET MED, DEPT FISHERIES, SETAGAYA KU, TOKYO 154, JAPAN",,"REN, DL (corresponding author), MIE UNIV, FAC BIORESOURCES, MARINE BIOCHEM LAB, TSU, MIE 514, JAPAN.",,,,,,,,,21,22,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,1994,60,4,,,,,423,427,,10.2331/fishsci.60.423,http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/fishsci.60.423,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:A1994PE60000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thirty-one investigators in 30 sites participated in this study consisting of a 8-week washout period followed by a g-week open-label treatment period. One hundred ninety-nine patients (144 with type IIa hyperlipidemia [triglycerides less than or equal to 200 mg/dl] and 55 with type IIb hyperlipidemia [triglycerides >200 mg/dl]) were evaluated. Patients were eligible for inclusion if their total cholesterol was greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl and less than or equal to 300 mg/dl after the washout period. The evaluation of efficacy was based on percentage changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), TC/HDL-C ratio, LDL-CMDL-C ratio, and total triglycerides. Clinical safety was assessed by evaluating the rate of spontaneous adverse experiences and by measuring blood pressure, pulse rate, and body weight. Adverse laboratory values were also evaluated. The mean percent changes from baseline at week 6 were -17.8% in the simvastatin group versus -10.5% in the gemfibrozil group (P < 0.01) for total cholesterol, -26% in the simvastatin group versus -11.8% in the gemfibrozil group (P < 0.01) for LDL-C, + 10.2% in the simvastatin group versus +16.2% in the gemfibrozil group (not significant [NS]) for HDL-C, and -13.9% in the simvastatin group versus -32% in the gemfibrozil group (P < 0.01) for total triglycerides. Simvastatin 5 mg reduced TC, LDL-C, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and the TC/HDL-C ratio more than gemfibrozil. The effect of gemfibrozil on total triglycerides and on HDL-C was larger than that of simvastatin 5 mg. No firm conclusions could be drawn from subgroup analyses because of the limited sample size. Both drugs were well tolerated. The treatment groups were similar with respect to the proportion of patients with clinical and laboratory adverse experiences (II in the simvastatin group versus 17 in the gemfibrozil group-NS).

Lipid results were categorized into six different levels of BMI: (1) 21.0 kg/m2 or lower, (2) 21.1 to 23.0 kg/m2, (3) 23.1 to 25.0 kg/m2, (4) 25.1 to 27.0 kg/m2, (5) 27.1 to 30.0 k g/m2, and (6) greater than 30.0 kg/m2, and three age groups: (1) young men (20 through 44 years), (2) middle-aged men (45 through 59 years), and (3) older men (60 through 74 years). Results: Using linear trend analysis, changes in BMI from categories 2 to 5 in young men were associated with a total cholesterol level 0.59 mmol/L (23 mg/dL) higher (P<.01), a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level 0.70 mmol/L (27 mg/dL) higher (P<.01), and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level 0.59 mmol/L (23 mg/dL) higher (P=.03). For middle-aged men and older men, the same change in BMI was associated with smaller but still significant differences in total cholesterol levels (higher by 0.31 mmol/L [12 mg/dL] [P<.01] and 0.28 mmol/L [11 mg/dL] [P<.01], respectively) and non-HDL cholesterol levels (higher by 0.37 mmol/L [14 mg/dL] [P<.01] and 0.25 mmol/L [10 mg/dL] [P<.01], respectively), whereas the LDL cholesterol levels were unchanged. Although advancing age may blunt the BMI-associated differences in total and LDL cholesterol levels, the BMI-associated differences in triglyceride levels (higher by 0.70 to 1.33 mmol/L [62 to 118 mg/dL] [P<.001]) and HDL cholesterol levels (lower by 0.18 to 0.39 mmol/L [7 to 15 mg/dL] [P<.001]) were of similar magnitude in all age groups. Conclusions: Excess body weight is associated with deleterious changes in the lipoprotein profile. Higher BMI was associated at all ages with higher plasma triglyceride level, lower HDL cholesterol level, and higher total and non-HDL cholesterol levels. In young men, the higher total cholesterol level was reflected mainly in the LDL cholesterol level; in middle-aged and older men, in the non-HDL fraction. Programs to reduce coronary heart disease by improving lipid levels should include more emphasis on achieving and maintaining ideal body weight.","UNIV TEXAS, SW MED CTR, DEPT INTERNAL MED, DALLAS, TX 75235 USA; UNIV TEXAS, SW MED CTR, DEPT BIOCHEM, DALLAS, TX 75235 USA; UNIV TEXAS, SW MED CTR, DEPT CLIN NUTR, DALLAS, TX 75235 USA; NATL CTR HLTH STAT, DIV HLTH EXAMINAT STAT, HYATTSVILLE, MD 20782 USA",,"DENKE, MA (corresponding author), UNIV TEXAS, SW MED CTR, CTR HUMAN NUTR, 5323 HARRY HINES BLVD, DALLAS, TX 75235 USA.",,,,,,,,,179,185,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 10,1993,153,9,,,,,1093,1103,,10.1001/archinte.153.9.1093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.153.9.1093,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:A1993LA71100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been suggested that adverse effects on lipids of traditional diuretic or beta-blocker regimens may diminish the potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension and normal serum lipids (n = 191) were randomly assigned to doxazosin or atenolol. After dose titration to goal diastolic blood pressure of less-than-or-equal-to 90 mm Hg, patients continued treatment for a further 24 weeks. The principal outcome measurement was overall coronary artery disease risk using the Framingham formula. Relative risk of coronary artery disease was reduced to 92.4% of baseline (p = 0.144) for evaluable patients taking atenolol (n = 71), and to 74.6% (p = 0.0001) for patients taking doxazosin (n = 51): atenolol versus doxazosin, p = 0.0074. In patients who met the strict Framingham criteria for age, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, the relative risk of coronary artery disease for patients taking atenolol (n = 23) was reduced to 86.2% of baseline (p = 0.082), and to 67.4% (p = 0.0004) for patients taking doxazosin (n = 18): atenolol versus doxazosin, p = 0.049. Alpha blockade with doxazosin was more effective than beta blockade with atenolol in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease in hypertensive patients because of the beneficial effects of doxazosin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Overall withdrawal rate was greater in the alpha-blocker group because of a lower response rate and more adverse events.",,,"CARRUTHERS, G (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV,VICTORIA GEN HOSP,442 BETHUNE,HALIFAX B3H 2Y9,NS,CANADA.",,,,,,,,,23,23,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,1993,71,7,,,,,575,581,,10.1016/0002-9149(93)90514-D,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0002-9149(93)90514-D,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:A1993KN63000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alpha-1 selective blockers exhibit a favorable impact on lipids, particularly on HDL-cholesterol. Unlike beta-blockers, they do not increase triglycerides and they do not produce the increase in LDL-cholesterol observed with traditional doses of diuretics.

Total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were not associated with restenosis. There was a significantly lower level of the monounsaturated fat palmitoleic acid (p < 0.02), a trend towards a lower level of the monounsaturated fat oleic acid (p < 0.09), and a trend towards a higher level of the saturated fat palmitic acid (p < 0.08) in the restenosis group.

The present study was designed to define the effect of clentiazem (10 mg/kg/day) an antihypertensive drug, on hyperlipidemia in rabbits on a cholesterol-rich diet (1%) for 12 weeks. Compared with controls, clentiazem treated rabbits had lower plasma concentrations of triglycerides (55%), total cholesterol (24%), free cholesterol (27%), esterified cholesterol (23%) and phospholipids (24%). The decrease in cholesterol was accounted for by a reduction of VLDL-cholesterol (13%), IDL-cholesterol (24%) and primarily LDL-cholesterol (45%). Neither HDL-cholesterol nor chemical composition of VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL was altered. When the aortic atherosclerotic involvement was evaluated by computerized planimetry, a 24% reduction of lesions was noted in clentiazem treated animals (P < 0.05). Similarly, cholesterol content extracted from aortic wall was decreased. Our data therefore demonstrated that clentiazem is a potential antiatherosclerotic agent capable of decreasing plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins as well as aortic fatty streaks.","UNIV MONTREAL,DEPT NUTR,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,QUEBEC,CANADA; UNIV MONTREAL,DEPT ANAT,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,QUEBEC,CANADA; UNIV MONTREAL,DEPT PATHOL,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,QUEBEC,CANADA",,"LEVY, E (corresponding author), HOP ST JUSTINE,RES CTR,3175 COTE ST CATHERINE,MONTREAL H3T 1C5,QUEBEC,CANADA.",,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,1991,90,2-3,,,,,141,148,,10.1016/0021-9150(91)90108-F,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0021-9150(91)90108-F,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-03,WOS:A1991GP57800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design: Repeat coronary angiography after two year treatment and evaluation of changes in coronary narrowings. Setting: Subjects with effort angina of recent onset requiring coronary angiography and medical treatment. Patients: 80 untreated patients, with a greater-than-or-equal-to 50 percent focal narrowing on a major coronary branch associated or not with a < 50 percent stenosis of other major branches. They were randomized to isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg bid) (group 1, control group) or to propranolol (80 mg qid) (group 2, treatment group). Results: At restudy, there were more diseased vessels and more narrowings per patient in both groups. Multivessel involvement and greater-than-or-equal-to 50 percent obstructions were also augmented. These changes were not statistically significant. Patients with progression of the stenotic tracts (both greater-than-or-equal-to 50 percent and < 50 percent were 19 (48 percent) in group 1 and 28 (70 percent) in group 2 (p < 0.05). Narrowings with progression were 25 in group 1 and 48 in group 2. Thirteen narrowings in group 1 and 15 in group 2 were newly detected at restudy. Eighteen patients (45 percent) in group 1 and nine (23 percent) in group 2 had a steady disease. Smoking, high blood pressure, family history of coronary disease, blood glucose values and lipid levels were considered; the only significant group differences were 31 percent rise of total triglyceride and 23 percent decrease of HDL cholesterol in patients who were treated with propranolol. Conclusions: Propranolol showed an adverse influence on coronary atherosclerosis, regarding the evolution of both greater-than-or-equal-to 50 percent and < 50 percent narrowings and not the formation of new stenoses.
