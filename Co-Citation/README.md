This project serves as an introduction to counting co-citation pairs in a citation network. Co-citation is any instance when two papers are cited by another paper, thereby establishing a link between the two papers. If two papers have a high rate of co-citation, this is evidence that the research community has determined them to be sufficiently correlated to warrant citing both papers. 

Part one of this project simply returns a count of co-citations in the network. Part two is a rudimentary attempt at graphing said co-citation network. For future attempts at graphing, I would recommend reducing the number of nodes significantly, as the graphs this code produces are not highly legible. 

The Jupyter notebook with explanations of my methodology and results is located in this folder as well.
